FADE IN:

EXT. SHANNON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Shannon (18) is sitting on the front porch of her house, staring off into the distance. She looks lost and broken. We can hear the sound of sirens in the distance.

SHANNON

(voice-over)

I never thought this would be my life. My parents are gone and I have nothing left. I thought coming here would help, but I was wrong.

Suddenly, Shannon's grandfather, JAMES (60), appears out of nowhere. Shannon is shocked.

JAMES

(to Shannon)

I'm sorry, child. I know this is hard, but you have to be strong.

Shannon looks at her grandfather, confused.

SHANNON

(to James)

What are you talking about? How did you get here so fast?

JAMES

(to Shannon)

I'll explain everything, but first we have to go. They're coming for us.

Shannon is about to say something, but James grabs her hand and pulls her away with him. Shannon doesn't know what to think or do.

FADE OUT.
