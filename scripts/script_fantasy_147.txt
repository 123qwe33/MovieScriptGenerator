FADE IN:


EXT. FOREST - DAY

Eogan and his fellow warriors are engaged in a fierce battle. Swords clash and arrows fly through the air. Eogan fights with skill and precision, taking down enemy after enemy. He is surrounded on all sides, but he does not falter.

Suddenly, a giant ogre appears and charges towards Eogan. Eogan stands his ground and prepares to fight, but the ogre is too strong. Just as the ogre is about to strike Eogan down, a friend appears and kills the ogre with a well-placed arrow.

Eogan nods his thanks to his friend and they continue fighting. The battle rages on, but eventually the enemy is defeated and the warriors triumph.

Eogan and his friends return to their village, where they are greeted by cheering crowds. Eogan is a hero, but he knows that this is only the beginning. The real challenge lies ahead.
