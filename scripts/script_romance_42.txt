INT. AISHA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

AISHA (20) is sitting at her desk, writing in a journal. She is lost in thought, and we can see the conflict in her eyes.

AISHA'S MOTHER (O.S.)

Aisha, come downstairs. We need to talk to you.

AISHA doesn't respond, lost in her thoughts.

AISHA'S MOTHER (O.S.)

Aisha!

AISHA snaps out of her reverie and gets up from her desk. She takes a deep breath and goes downstairs.

AISHA'S MOTHER and FATHER are waiting for her in the living room. They both look serious.

AISHA'S MOTHER

Sit down, Aisha.

AISHA sits down, her heart racing. She knows this is not going to be good.

AISHA'S FATHER

Aisha, we've been talking, and we've made a decision.

AISHA'S MOTHER

You're going to date the man we've chosen for you.

AISHA'S FATHER

He's wealthy and connected, and he comes from a good family.

AISHA'S MOTHER

You need to start thinking about your future, and this is the best way to do it.

AISHA is torn. She knows what her parents want, but she also knows what she wants.

AISHA

I can't do that. I'm sorry.

AISHA'S MOTHER

Aisha, you have to.

AISHA'S FATHER

If you don't, you will be disowned.

AISHA knows this is not an empty threat. Her parents are serious.

AISHA

I'm sorry, but I can't do it.

AISHA'S MOTHER

Fine. Then you're not part of this family anymore.

AISHA'S FATHER

You will never see us again.

AISHA knows this is goodbye. She knows it will be hard, but she also knows she made the right choice.
