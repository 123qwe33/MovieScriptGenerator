FADE IN:

EXT. JENNA'S HOUSE - EVENING

Jenna finishes her shift at the hospital and heads home, looking forward to her evening run. She doesn't notice the stranger watching her from the shadows.

JENNA

(to herself)

Finally, I can get some me time.

She changes into her running clothes and heads out the door.

EXT. JENNA'S NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING

Jenna begins her run, unaware that the stranger is following her.

JENNA

(panting)

This is exactly what I needed.

She rounds a corner and the stranger finally approaches her.

STRANGER

Hello, Jenna.

She stops, surprised and scared.

JENNA

Who are you? How do you know my name?

STRANGER

I know a lot about you, Jenna.

She takes a step back from him.

JENNA

I don't know what you're talking about.

STRANGER

Don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you.

Jenna looks around, trying to find a way to escape.

JENNA

What do you want from me?

STRANGER

I just want to talk.

JENNA

About what?

STRANGER

About us.

JENNA

There is no us. I don't even know you.

STRANGER

But I know you, Jenna. I know everything about you.

She takes another step back from him, her heart racing.

JENNA

I'm going to call the police.

STRANGER

There's no need for that. I'm not going to hurt you.

JENNA

How do I know I can trust you?

STRANGER

You don't. But I can promise you that I mean you no harm.

Jenna looks around, trying to decide what to do. She's clearly scared but also intrigued.

JENNA

Okay. I'll talk to you. But we're going to do it in a public place.

STRANGER

Of course.

He leads her to a nearby park and they sit down on a bench.

JENNA

So, talk.

STRANGER

I've been watching you for a long time, Jenna. I know everything about you.

Jenna looks at him, surprised.

JENNA

How?

STRANGER

I have my ways.

JENNA

Who are you?

STRANGER

My name is Alexander.

JENNA

Okay, Alexander. Why are you watching me?

STRANGER

I'm drawn to you, Jenna. I can't help it.

JENNA

Why?

STRANGER

I don't know. There's just something about you that I can't resist.

JENNA

Is this some kind of joke?

STRANGER

No, I'm serious. I know it sounds crazy, but I'm in love with you.

JENNA

In love with me? We just met.

STRANGER

I know. It doesn't make any sense. But I can't help how I feel.

Jenna looks at him, trying to decide what to believe.

JENNA

So, what now?

STRANGER

I want to date you, Jenna. I want to be with you.

JENNA

I don't know. This is all so sudden.

STRANGER

I know. But I promise you, I'm a good person. You have nothing to worry about.

JENNA

I don't know. This is all so crazy.

STRANGER

I know. But sometimes the best things in life are the crazy ones.

Jenna looks at him for a long moment, her heart racing. She's clearly scared but also intrigued. Finally, she makes her decision.

JENNA

Okay. I'll go out with you.

STRANGER

Really?

JENNA

Yes. But I have one condition.

STRANGER

Anything.

JENNA

You have to promise me that you won't hurt me
