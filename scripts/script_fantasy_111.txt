FADE IN:

EXT. KINGDOM - DAY

The sun beats down on the land, wilting the crops and drying up the wells. The people of the kingdom are desperate, and they turn to their king for help.

KING

My people, I can see that you are suffering. I will not rest until I find out what is causing this. I am calling on all brave adventurers to venture into the forest and find out what is happening.

A group of heroes steps forward, ready to take on the challenge. They venture into the forest, and are immediately met with danger.

HERO 1

What is this place?

HERO 2

It's like nothing I've ever seen before.

Suddenly, they are attacked by a group of monsters. They fight bravely, but are outnumbered and outmatched.

HERO 1

We have to find the sorceress responsible for this and stop her!

They continue deeper into the forest, and finally come face to face with the evil sorceress.

SORCERESS

You foolish mortals. You think you can defeat me?

They battle the sorceress, and after a long and hard fight, they emerge victorious. The kingdom is saved, and the people can finally live in peace again.
