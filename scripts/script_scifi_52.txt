INT. SAMANTHA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Samantha is sitting at her kitchen table, looking at a map of the world. The map is covered in red, signifying the areas that have been affected by the environmental disaster. She looks exhausted.

Suddenly, her phone rings. She picks it up and sees that it's a number she doesn't recognize. She answers it.

SAMANTHA
Hello?

MAN'S VOICE
Samantha? This is Dr. Jameson. We met a few months ago at the conference?

SAMANTHA
Oh, right. What can I do for you, Dr. Jameson?

DR. JAMESON
I'm calling to offer you a job.

SAMANTHA
A job?

DR. JAMESON
Yes. I'm heading up a research team that's working on a new form of energy. I think you would be perfect for the team.

SAMANTHA
I'm not a scientist.

DR. JAMESON
You don't need to be. I need someone who's smart and resourceful. And I think you have the potential to be a great asset to the team.

SAMANTHA
I don't know.

DR. JAMESON
Just come and meet with me. If you're not interested, you can walk away. No pressure.

SAMANTHA
Okay. When?

DR. JAMESON
How about tomorrow?

SAMANTHA
Sure.

DR. JAMESON
Great. I'll send you the address.

Samantha hangs up the phone and looks at the map again. She sighs and gets up from the table.

FADE OUT.
