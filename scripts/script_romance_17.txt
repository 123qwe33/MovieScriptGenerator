FADE IN:

EXT. PARIS - DAY

Elise walks along the busy streets of Paris, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. She stops to buy a flower from a street vendor and continues on her way.

Suddenly, she bumps into a handsome man, Pierre. They both apologize and Elise is about to continue on her way when Pierre asks for her name.

ELISE

Elise.

PIERRE

A beautiful name for a beautiful woman.

Elise blushes and Pierre asks if he can buy her a drink. She agrees and they go to a nearby cafe.

As they sit and chat, Elise quickly falls for Pierre's charms. He seems like the perfect gentleman.

However, Pierre tells her that he is already betrothed to another woman and cannot return her affections. Elise is heartbroken but tries to hide her disappointment.

PIERRE

I'm sorry, Elise. I wish things could be different.

ELISE

It's okay, Pierre. I understand.

FADE OUT.
