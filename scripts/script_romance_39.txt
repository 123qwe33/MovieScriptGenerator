FADE IN:

EXT. STREETS OF MUMBAI - NIGHT

Maya (20s) steps out of a taxi and looks around at the bustling city. She takes a deep breath and smiles, excited for what the future holds.

MAYA

This is it. The start of my new life.

She grabs her bags and starts to walk towards her new apartment.

MAYA (CONT'D)

I can't believe I'm finally here. Mumbai, the city of dreams.

Suddenly, she hears someone calling her name.

VOICE (O.S.)

Maya! Maya, over here!

She turns to see her old friend, Rohan (30s), waving at her from across the street.

MAYA

Rohan! I can't believe it's really you!

They hug each other tightly.

ROHAN

I can't believe you're really here! I heard you were coming to Mumbai but I didn't think it was true.

MAYA

It is true! I'm finally here, and I'm never leaving.

Rohan takes her bags and they start walking towards her apartment.

ROHAN

So, how was your trip?

MAYA

It was good. I'm just so excited to be here.

ROHAN

I can't believe you finally made it. We always said we'd come to Mumbai and make it big in Bollywood, and here you are.

MAYA

I know. It's all thanks to you. If you hadn't helped me out, I would have never even gotten my foot in the door.

Rohan smiles and opens the door to her apartment.

ROHAN

Well, you're here now. And I'm going to make sure you make it big.

MAYA

Thank you, Rohan. I really appreciate it.

They say goodbye and Rohan leaves. Maya looks around her new apartment and smiles, excited for the adventure that lies ahead.
