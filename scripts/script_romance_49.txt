INT. CAR - NIGHT

We see a woman driving on a dark road. She is tired and looks like she has been driving for a long time.Suddenly, she hits a pothole and the car swerves off the road. She screams as the car crashes into a tree.

INT. FOREST - NIGHT

The woman wakes up and finds herself in a dark forest. She is disoriented and confused. She sees a light in the distance and starts to make her way towards it.

As she gets closer, she sees a huge mansion. A man is standing in the doorway and he looks at her with surprise.

MAN:

Who are you?

WOMAN:

I- I don't know. What is this place?

MAN:

This is my home.

The man introduces himself as Adrian and helps the woman to her feet.

WOMAN:

What happened? I remember crashing my car.

ADRIAN:

You hit your head pretty hard. You've been unconscious for a while.

WOMAN:

How long have I been here?

ADRIAN:

A few days.

WOMAN:

Days?

Adrian takes the woman inside and she is surprised by the lavish interior of the mansion.

ADRIAN:

Make yourself comfortable. I'll get you something to drink.

WOMAN:

Thank you.

Adrian brings the woman a glass of wine and she takes a sip.

WOMAN:

This is really good.

ADRIAN:

I'm glad you like it.

The woman looks at Adrian and feels a sudden connection to him.

WOMAN:

Thank you for taking care of me.

ADRIAN:

It's no problem. I'm just glad you're okay.

The woman and Adrian spend the next few days getting to know each other. Adrian tells her about his dark past and she shares stories about her life.

They both feel a deep connection to each other.

One night, Adrian confesses his feelings for the woman and kisses her.

As they kiss, the woman feels a sudden jolt of electricity.

WOMAN:

What was that?

ADRIAN:

I don't know. But I feel it too.

From then on, the woman and Adrian begin a passionate romance.

However, there are others who are not happy about their relationship.

Adrian's ex-girlfriend, a powerful witch, is determined to separate them.

She casts a spell on the woman which causes her to have terrifying nightmares.

Adrian is able to protect her during the day but at night, she is defenceless.

The witch also enlists the help of a group of vampires who wish to harm Adrian.

They attack the mansion but Adrian and the woman are able to fight them off.

 However, the woman is seriously injured in the process.

Adrian is frantic with worry and takes her to see a healer.

The healer is able to help the woman but warns Adrian that the witch will not give up easily.

Adrian is determined to protect the woman and fight for their relationship.

With the help of his friends, he sets out to find the witch and end her reign of terror.
