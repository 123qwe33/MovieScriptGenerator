FADE IN:

EXT. MARS - DAY

A group of Martian soldiers are patrolling the area. They are armed with guns and wearing armor. They are all covered in dust.

Suddenly, one of the soldiers spots something in the distance. He points it out to the others.

SOLDIER

What is that?

They all approach the object. It is a capsule.

SOLDIER

It's a capsule from Earth!

They all gather around the capsule. One of the soldiers opens it. Inside is a woman. She is in stasis.

SOLDIER

She's alive!

They all help to thaw and revive the woman. She wakes up and looks around, confused.

WOMAN

What... what is this place?

SOLDIER

You're on Mars.

WOMAN

Mars? But... how?

The woman looks at all of the soldiers.

WOMAN

Who are you?

SOLDIER

We're Martians.

The woman is shocked.

WOMAN

But... that's impossible.

SOLDIER

It's not impossible. We're here.

The woman looks around, still in disbelief.

WOMAN

How long have I been in stasis?

SOLDIER

Years. Many years.

WOMAN

What happened?

SOLDIER

There was a war. A global war. It destroyed Earth.

The woman is horrified.

WOMAN

No...

SOLDIER

We were the lucky ones. We were able to escape to Mars. But we've been cut off from Earth since then.

The woman looks at all of the soldiers.

WOMAN

You're all that's left?

SOLDIER

Yes.

The woman is saddened by this news.

WOMAN

I'm sorry.

SOLDIER

Don't be. We're survivors. We've been through a lot, but we're still here.

The woman looks around.

WOMAN

This place is so... different.

SOLDIER

It's not like Earth, that's for sure. But it's our home.

The woman is still in disbelief.

WOMAN

I can't believe it. I can't believe I'm really on Mars.

SOLDIER

Welcome to Mars.
