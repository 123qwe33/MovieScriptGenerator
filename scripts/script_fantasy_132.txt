FADE IN:


EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

The sound of screams and battle cries fill the air as two armies clash. Men and women fight with everything they have, their very lives at stake. In the midst of the chaos, one young man stands out.

XANDER

(to himself)

This is it. This is my chance to prove myself.

He draws his sword and charges into the fray. He swings and parries, fighting with the skill of a seasoned warrior. His enemies fall before him, but he does not stop. He keeps going, driven by the need to prove himself.

Suddenly, he is surrounded by enemy soldiers. They close in on him, swords raised.

XANDER

(to himself)

This is it. I'm going to die.

But before they can strike, Xander is saved by a group of his fellow soldiers. They fight off the enemies, giving Xander time to catch his breath.

XANDER

(to his fellow soldiers)

Thank you. I thought I was a goner for sure.

SOLDIER 1

(claps him on the shoulder)

No problem, kid. We've all been there.

XANDER

(nods)

I guess this is what it means to be a soldier.

FADE OUT.
