FADE IN:

EXT. AISHA'S HOUSE - DAY

Aisha (20s) is sitting on the front porch of her house, reading a book. She looks up as her best friend, Priya (20s), approaches.

PRIYA

Hey, Aisha!

AISHA

Hey, Priya. What's up?

PRIYA

Not much. I just wanted to come over and see how you're doing.

AISHA

I'm fine.

PRIYA

You sure? You've been kind of quiet lately.

AISHA

I'm just a little preoccupied, that's all.

PRIYA

Is it Dev?

AISHA

No. I mean, yes. I don't know.

PRIYA

Aisha, you can talk to me. I'm your best friend.

AISHA

I know. It's just... I don't want to talk about it.

PRIYA

Okay. I understand. But if you ever need to talk, you know I'm here for you.

AISHA

Thanks, Priya.

PRIYA

No problem. I'll see you later.

AISHA

Bye.

Priya walks away and Aisha goes back to her book. She looks up as a car pulls up in front of her house. Dev (20s) gets out of the car and walks up to the porch.

DEV

Hey, Aisha.

AISHA

Hey, Dev. What are you doing here?

DEV

I wanted to talk to you.

AISHA

 about what?

DEV

Us.

AISHA

There is no us, Dev. You made that clear when you left me.

DEV

I know. I was an idiot. I was young and stupid and I made a mistake.

AISHA

A mistake? You used me, Dev. You used me for my money.

DEV

I know. And I'm sorry.

AISHA

Sorry doesn't cut it.

DEV

I know. But I'm hoping you'll give me another chance.

AISHA

Why would I do that?

DEV

Because I love you.

AISHA

No, you don't. You never did.

DEV

I was young and stupid, but I've changed. I'm not that person anymore.

AISHA

It doesn't matter. I'm not interested.

DEV

Aisha, please. Just give me another chance.

AISHA

No.

DEV

Fine. But I'm not giving up. I'll win you back, Aisha. I promise.

AISHA

Whatever.

Dev walks away and Aisha goes back to her book.

FADE OUT.
