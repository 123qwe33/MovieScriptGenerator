FADE IN:

EXT. DARK, SEEDY CITY - NIGHT

The city is a dark, looming presence, filled with shadows and danger. The streets are empty, except for the occasional car or person hurrying by.

A body lies in a pool of blood, discarded like trash. A single black rose lies next to it.

DETECTIVE JAMESON (late 30s, world-weary) stands over the body, looking down at it with a mix of disgust and resignation. He's seen this too many times.

He kneels down, examining the body. He sees a bloody handprint on the victim's throat.

JAMESON

Another one.

He stands up, looks around. There's no one in sight.

JAMESON

Damnit.

He pulls out his phone and calls for backup.

JAMESON

(into phone)

Yeah, I've got another one. Same MO as the others.

He hangs up and stuffs the phone back into his pocket.

He looks down at the body again, then around at the empty streets.

JAMESON

Who are you? What do you want?

There's no answer but the sound of the wind blowing through the city.

JAMESON

(to himself)

I'll find you. I promise.
