FADE IN:

EXT. A small village in the middle of a warzone - day

EIN (10) sits on the edge of a roof, looking out at the destruction around her. The village is in ruins, and bodies are everywhere. EIN is covered in blood, but she does not seem to be hurt.

EIN

(to herself)

They're all dead...

Suddenly, EIN hears a noise from below. She looks down to see a group of soldiers approaching.

EIN

(to herself)

Shit.

EIN quickly runs to the other side of the roof and jumps down, landing in an alleyway. She runs through the alleyways, trying to lose the soldiers.

Suddenly, EIN runs into a dead end. She looks around, desperate for an escape.

EIN

(to herself)

This is it...

EIN turns around to face the soldiers, who are now closing in on her.

EIN

(to the soldiers)

Come and get me, you bastards!

FADE TO BLACK.
