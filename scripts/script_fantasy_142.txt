FADE IN:

EXT. FOREST - DAY

A group of people are running through the forest, being chased by a group of soldiers. The soldiers are firing at them, but they manage to stay ahead of them.

Suddenly, they come to a cliff. There is a river below.

One of the people, a woman, stops and looks back at the soldiers. She takes a deep breath and then jumps off the cliff into the river.

The other people follow her. They all manage to make it to the other side safely.

The soldiers reach the edge of the cliff and look down at the river. They don't bother to try and cross it.

The people are now safe, but they are not out of the woods yet. They have to keep moving.

FADE OUT.
