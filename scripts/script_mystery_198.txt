FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Rain pours down on the city, drenching everything in sight. A lone car drives down the empty streets.

INT. DETECTIVE WATANABE'S CAR - NIGHT

Detective Makoto Watanabe sits in the driver's seat, his tired eyes focused on the road. His radio crackles to life.

DISPATCH (V.O.)

We have a 10-54 in progress, possible homicide. Alleyway between First and Second Street.

Makoto sighs and grabs his coat from the passenger seat.

MAKOTO

(into radio)

I'm on my way.

He steps out of his car and into the pouring rain.

EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

Makoto walks down the alley, his feet splashing in puddles of water. He stops when he sees the body of a young woman, lying in a pool of blood.

MAKOTO

(into radio)

Dispatch, I'm at the scene. We've got a confirmed homicide.

He kneels down next to the body, taking in the gruesome sight.

MAKOTO

(to himself)

What the hell happened here?

FADE TO BLACK.
