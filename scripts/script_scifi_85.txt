FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - SALAMANDAR XL7

The Salamandar XL7 is a mining vessel on a mission to find new sources of minerals and other resources. The ship is small and cramped, and the crew is made up of a ragtag group of prospectors and miners.

The ship enters a new system and begins scanning for planets with potential resources. After a few hours, they find a small, rocky planet with a rich deposit of a rare mineral.

The crew begins to land on the planet, and they are immediately attacked by a group of aliens. The aliens are armed with energy weapons and are intent on taking the mineral deposit for themselves.

The crew fights back, using their own weapons and their wits to defeat the aliens. They are victorious, but at a great cost. Many of the crew are killed or wounded.

With the aliens defeated, the crew begins to mine the mineral deposit. They quickly realize that they have stumbled upon a fortune, and they must now protect their find from others who would claim it for themselves.

The crew sets up a base camp and begins to fortify their position. They know that they will have to fight again to keep what is rightfully theirs.
