INT. DARK CAVERN - NIGHT

GARED (20s), a lowborn warrior, struggles through a dark and dangerous cavern. He is covered in sweat and his breathing is labored. He is fighting for his life.

Suddenly, he is attacked by a giant spider. He screams and tries to fight it off, but it is too strong. It sinks its fangs into his flesh and he falls to the ground, unconscious.

FADE TO BLACK.

INT. A LARGE CASTLE - DAY

Gared wakes up to find himself in a large and luxurious castle. He is lying in a comfortable bed, and a beautiful woman is standing over him.

Gared: Where am I?

Woman: You're in the castle of Lord Garron. You were brought here after being attacked by a giant spider.

Gared: Lord Garron?

Woman: He's the one who found you and brought you here. He's a powerful sorcerer.

Gared: What does he want with me?

Woman: He needs your help. There is a dragon that has been terrorizing the land. He wants you to help him track it down and slay it.

Gared: Me? I'm just a lowborn warrior. I'm not qualified to kill a dragon.

Woman: Lord Garron believes that you are the only one who can do it.

Gared: Why me?

Woman: He has seen something in you, something special. He believes that you have the strength and courage to do what needs to be done.

Gared: I don't know.

Woman: You don't have to decide now. Just get some rest and we'll talk again in the morning.

Gared: Alright.

FADE TO BLACK.

INT. GARED'S ROOM - NIGHT

Gared is lying in bed, trying to sleep. But he can't. He's too excited. He's never had an opportunity like this before. He's always been an outsider, never feeling like he belonged. But now he has a chance to prove his worth. He's going to kill a dragon.

He gets out of bed and starts to pace the room. He's too keyed up to sleep. He looks out the window at the full moon. Suddenly, he hears a noise. He freezes, listening. It sounds like someone is coming. He grabs his sword and hides in the shadows.

A figure enters the room. It's the woman from before.

Woman: I'm sorry to disturb you, but I thought you might want some company.

Gared: What are you doing here?

Woman: I just thought you might be lonely.

Gared: I'm not lonely. I'm excited. I'm going to kill a dragon.

Woman: Yes, you are. But it's not going to be easy.

Gared: I know.

Woman: You're going to have to be brave.

Gared: I am brave.

Woman: I know you are.

She comes closer and sits on the bed.

Gared: What's your name?

Woman: My name is Alarra.

Gared: That's a beautiful name.

Alarra: Thank you.

They stare at each other for a moment, then she leans in and kisses him. He kisses her back, and they fall into each other's arms.

FADE TO BLACK.

INT. GARED'S ROOM - DAWN

Gared wakes up to find Alarra gone. He gets out of bed and looks around the room. He sees a note on the table.

He picks it up and reads it.

Gared,

I'm sorry I had to leave so early, but I had to get back to the castle. Lord Garron is expecting you.

Don't worry, you'll be fine. I know you can do this.

Good luck,

Alarra

He folds up the note and puts it in his pocket. Then he picks up his sword and leaves the room.

INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

Gared walks down a long hallway, his sword in hand. He's on his way to meet Lord Garron. He's nervous, but he's also excited. He knows this is his chance to prove himself.

He comes to a door and knocks. A voice from inside tells him to enter. He does.
