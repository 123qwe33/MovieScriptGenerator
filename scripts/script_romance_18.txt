FADE IN:

EXT. PROVENCE, FRANCE - DAY

We see a beautiful landscape of rolling hills and vineyards. The sun is shining and there is a light breeze.

We see a young woman, ANTOINETTE, walking down a dirt road. She is carrying a basket of flowers. She is wearing a simple dress and a scarf around her head. She is barefoot.

As she walks, she sings a song in French.

ANTOINETTE

(singing)

Il était une fois, une jeune fille

Qui vivait dans les bois

Elle était si jolie

Tous les animaux l'aimaient

Mais un jour, un garçon

Est venu et l'a emmenée

Loin de sa famille

Elle ne l'a plus jamais revue

INT. MARCEL AND ANTOINETTE'S HOUSE - DAY

We see a young couple, MARCEL and ANTOINETTE, sitting at a table in their kitchen. They are eating breakfast and they are laughing and joking with each other.

MARCEL

(to Antoinette)

So, what do you want to do today, my love?

ANTOINETTE

(smiling)

I don't know. What do you want to do?

MARCEL

(standing up)

I think we should go for a walk in the vineyards. It's a beautiful day.

ANTOINETTE

(stands up)

That sounds perfect.

They put on their shoes and they walk out the door.

EXT. PROVENCE, FRANCE - DAY

We see Marcel and Antoinette walking hand in hand through the vineyards. They are laughing and talking.

MARCEL

Do you remember the first time we met?

ANTOINETTE

(smiling)

Of course I do. I was so nervous.

MARCEL

(laughing)

You were so cute. I knew I wanted to marry you from the moment I saw you.

ANTOINETTE

(laughs)

I'm glad you did. I can't imagine my life without you.

They kiss and they continue walking.
