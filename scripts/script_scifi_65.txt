FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - LONG AGO

A vast, empty expanse. Suddenly, a small object comes into view, growing larger as it approaches.

It is a space station, ancient and derelict. It drifts slowly through the void, silent and lifeless.

The camera moves closer, revealing the station in greater detail. It is heavily damaged, with great chunks of metal torn away.

There is no sign of life. No lights, no movement. It is as if the station has been abandoned for a very long time.

Suddenly, a small ship comes into view, approaching the station.

INT. SHIP

A team of aliens are aboard, studying the station. They are excited by their find, and eager to learn more about the ancient civilization that built it.

As they approach, they begin to realize that the station is in far worse condition than they thought. It is clear that something went wrong here, long ago.

They dock with the station, and begin to explore.

INT. STATION

The team moves cautiously through the dark, silent corridors. They are using all manner of scientific equipment to study the station.

As they move deeper into the station, they gradually come to realize that it was the site of a catastrophic experiment gone wrong. The remains of the ancient civilization that built it are still lurking inside, waiting to escape.

The team is now in grave danger, and they must find a way to escape the station before it is too late.
