FADE IN:

EXT. OUTER SPACE - DAY

A small spaceship is making its way through the vast expanse of outer space. On board is SAMANTHA JAMESON, a world-renowned astronomer. She's looking out the window at the stars, lost in thought.

Suddenly, the ship's alarm goes off. Samantha sits up, startled.

SAMANTHA

What's going on?

She gets up and goes to the ship's control panel. The captain, JAMESON, is looking at a screen with a worried expression on his face.

JAMESON

We've picked up a strange signal coming from a planet in the outer reaches of the solar system.

SAMANTHA

A planet?

JAMESON

Yeah. We're not sure what it is, but I'm going to go take a look.

SAMANTHA

I'll come with you.

JAMESON

No, it's too dangerous. I'll go alone.

SAMANTHA

But I'm the only one on this ship with any experience in astronomy. I could be a big help.

JAMESON

I don't want to risk your life, Samantha.

SAMANTHA

I can handle myself. Besides, what's the worst that could happen?

JAMESON

I don't know. But I'm not going to take any chances.

SAMANTHA

Please, Jameson. Let me come with you.

JAMESON

Fine. But stay close to me, and do what I say.

Samantha nods and follows Jameson out of the ship. They suit up in their space suits and make their way to the planet.

As they approach, Samantha starts to experience strange hallucinations. She sees the planet as a giant eye, staring down at her.

SAMANTHA

What the hell is this?

JAMESON

What's wrong?

SAMANTHA

I'm seeing things. Hallucinations.

JAMESON

It must be the radiation from the planet. We need to get out of here.

But it's too late. The closer they get to the planet, the more powerful the hallucinations become. Samantha is completely lose touch with reality.

JAMESON

Samantha, can you hear me?

There's no response. Jameson is starting to get worried.

JAMESON

Samantha, I'm going to have to make a decision. I can either turn back or continue on to the planet and risk the lives of everyone on board.

He pauses, thinking. Then he makes his decision.

JAMESON

We're going to continue on.

He turns the ship towards the planet. As they land, Samantha is confronted with the reality of what's happening.

SAMANTHA

What... what is this place?

JAMESON

I'm not sure. But I think the radiation from the planet is causing our hallucinations.

SAMANTHA

How can we get back to Earth?

JAMESON

We need to find a way to shield ourselves from the radiation.

Samantha nods and they start to look for a way to protect themselves. But they're not the only ones on the ship experiencing hallucinations. The entire crew is suffering from the same thing.

FADE TO BLACK.
