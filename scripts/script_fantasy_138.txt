FADE IN:

EXT. HARSH LANDSCAPE - DAY

A young woman, JENNA, walks across a harsh landscape. She is dirty and her clothes are tattered. She looks around her with a weary expression.

JENNA

(voice-over)

This is a land of harsh temperatures and little resources. The strong take what they want and the weak suffer. There is no room for weaklings in this land, only the strong and the vicious. I was born into a family of outcasts. My parents were killed when I was young, and I was raised by my grandparents in the harshest part of the land. I've always been a survivor, but when my grandparents are killed, I have to fend for myself.

She looks around her again, her expression determined.

JENNA

(voice-over)

I meet a man who claims to be a warrior, and he takes me under his wing. He teaches me how to fight and how to survive in this hostile land. I soon realize that he's not what he seems, and that he's only using me for his own gain. I decide to strike out on my own and find my own way in this difficult land. I meet other survivors and band together with them to face the hardships of this land. We fight and we scavenge, and we do whatever it takes to survive. This is a land where the strong take what they want, and the weak suffer. There is no room for weaklings here, only the strong and the vicious.
