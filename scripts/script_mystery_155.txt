EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DAY

Maggie Bradley walks out of her house for the last time, locking the door behind her. She takes a deep breath and starts to head down the street when she's suddenly stopped by her next door neighbor, Betty.

BETTY

Hey, Maggie! I'm so sorry to hear about your husband.

MAGGIE

Thank you, Betty. I'm just ready to start fresh.

BETTY

I can understand that. Shepherdstown is a great place to start over. I'm sure you'll love it here.

MAGGIE

I hope so.

BETTY

Well, if you need anything, don't hesitate to ask. I'm always happy to help.

MAGGIE

Thank you, Betty. I appreciate that.

Maggie gives Betty a hug, then starts down the street towards her new home.

EXT. SHEPHERDSTOWN - DAY

Maggie Bradley walks down the street of Shepherdstown, taking in her new surroundings. She smiles as she sees the quaint shops and friendly faces. She's interrupted from her thoughts by a voice calling her name.

RUTH

Maggie! Oh, I'm so glad I ran into you.

Maggie turns to see Ruth, a member of the local knitting club.

RUTH

I was just on my way to the yarn shop. Would you like to join me?

MAGGIE

I would love to.

Ruth and Maggie start walking down the street, chatting as they go.

RUTH

So, have you joined the knitting club yet?

MAGGIE

No, not yet. I'm not really sure if it's my thing.

RUTH

Nonsense. You'll love it. We have so much fun. And you're such a talented knitter. I'm sure the other members would love to have you.

MAGGIE

I don't know...

RUTH

Come on, it'll be fun. I'll introduce you to everyone.

MAGGIE

Okay, I'll join.

RUTH

Great! I'll see you at the next meeting.

Maggie and Ruth say goodbye and go their separate ways. Maggie continues down the street, lost in thought.

EXT. SHEPHERDSTOWN - DAY

Maggie Bradley is out for a leisurely walk, enjoying the sunny day. She's so lost in thought that she doesn't see the body lying in the bushes until she's right on top of it. She gasps and takes a step back, her hand over her mouth in shock.

MAGGIE

Oh my god...

Maggie quickly recovers from her shock and runs to the nearest house to get help.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Maggie Bradley is being questioned by the police about the dead body she found.

DETECTIVE

So, you say you didn't know the victim?

MAGGIE

No, I'd never seen her before in my life.

DETECTIVE

And you have no idea who could have done this?

MAGGIE

No, I have no idea.

DETECTIVE

Okay, thank you for your time, Mrs. Bradley. We'll be in touch if we have any more questions.

Maggie gets up to leave, but is stopped by the detective.

DETECTIVE

Oh, one more thing. We found this near the body.

The detective hands Maggie a knitting needle. Maggie's eyes widen in shock as she realizes she's being framed for the murder.
