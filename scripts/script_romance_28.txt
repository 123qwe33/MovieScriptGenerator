FADE IN:

EXT. PARIS - NIGHT

The Eiffel Tower looms over the City of Lights as we pan down to the busy streets below.

CAMILLE (late 20s) walks down the sidewalk, looking up at the tower longingly. She’s lost in thought and doesn’t notice as she bumps into a man.

OLIVIER (late 20s) apologizes profusely and helps her up. They stare into each other’s eyes for a moment before Olivier breaks the spell by asking her name.

CAMILLE

Camille.

OLIVIER

Olivier.

He takes her hand and kisses it, charmed by her.

OLIVIER (CONT’D)

Can I buy you a drink, Camille?

CAMILLE

I’d love one.

He takes her arm and they walk down the street, chatting and laughing like old friends.

FADE TO BLACK.
