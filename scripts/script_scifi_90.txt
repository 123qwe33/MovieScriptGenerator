FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - THE MILKY WAY GALAXY

The camera pans across the vast expanse of the galaxy. We see countless stars, planets, and other celestial bodies. In the distance, a large fleet of ships can be seen engaged in battle.

Suddenly, the camera zooms in on one of the ships. It is a Republic cruiser. The ship is under attack by a Separatist destroyer. The cruiser is badly damaged, and it is clear that it won't be able to hold out much longer.

On the bridge of the cruiser, CAPTAIN REX is giving orders to his crew.

CAPTAIN REX

All hands, abandon ship! Get to the escape pods! That's an order!

The crew starts to panic, but they quickly snap into action. They begin to evacuate the ship.

 CAPTAIN REX

(to himself)

There's no time. I have to get to the escape pods.

 Rex starts to make his way to the escape pods, but he is stopped by a blast from the Separatist destroyer. The blast sends him flying across the bridge.

He hits the ground hard and does not get up.

The camera pans across the bridge. The crew is gone. Rex is the only one left.

The cruiser is hit by another blast. This one is even bigger than the last.

The ship starts to break apart.

CAPTAIN REX

(to himself)

Noâ€¦ this can't be the end.

The camera pans out as the ship is destroyed.

FADE TO BLACK.
