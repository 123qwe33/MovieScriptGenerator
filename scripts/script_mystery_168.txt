FADE IN:

EXT. PEGGY'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

PEGGY, a middle-aged woman, is out walking her dog. She sees something in her neighbor's garden and goes to investigate.

PEGGY

Oh my goodness!

She has found the body of her elderly neighbor, MRS. PATTERSON.

PEGGY (CONT'D)

(shocked and saddened)

Mrs. Patterson!

PEGGY (CONT'D)

(to herself)

Who would do such a thing?

PEGGY (CONT'D)

(decides to take it upon herself to find out who killed Mrs. Patterson)

I'll have to ask around and see if anyone knows anything.

FADE OUT.
