FADE IN:

EXT. JENNA'S BOOKSTORE - DAY

Jenna (30s) unlocks the door to her new bookstore and steps inside. She looks around, taking in her new business. She's excited to get started.

JENNA

(to herself)

This is it. My new beginning.

She begins to unpack boxes of books.

INT. JENNA'S BOOKSTORE - LATER

Jenna is stacking books on a shelf when she hears the door open. She looks over and sees Rachel (40s), the local librarian.

JENNA

Hi, Rachel. I'm Jenna, the new owner of the bookstore.

RACHEL

Nice to meet you, Jenna. I'm sure your store will be a great addition to the town.

Jenna smiles and continues to stack books.

JENNA

Thanks. I'm excited to get started.

RACHEL

If you need any help getting settled in, just let me know.

JENNA

I will. Thanks.

 Rachel starts to browse the books. Jenna goes back to work.

INT. JENNA'S BOOKSTORE - NEXT DAY

Jenna is unpacking more boxes of books when she hears a noise. She looks around, but doesn't see anything. She shrugs it off and goes back to work.

Suddenly, she hears the noise again. This time, she realizes it's coming from the back room. She slowly walks towards the back, wondering if someone is in her store.

She pushes open the door to the back room and gasps. Lying on the floor is the dead body of a woman (30s). Jenna is in shock.

FADE TO BLACK.
