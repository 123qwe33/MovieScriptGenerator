INT. SHEPHERDSTOWN POLICE STATION - DAY

Mallory is sitting at a desk, writing on a notepad. She looks up as Anna walks in.

ANNA

Mallory, I need your help.

Mallory puts down her pen and leans back in her chair.

MALLORY

What's wrong?

ANNA

I think I'm being framed for murder.

Mallory sits up, shocked.

MALLORY

What happened?

ANNA

Charles Shepherd was killed last night, and the police think I did it.

Mallory is stunned.

MALLORY

That's impossible. You loved him.

ANNA

I know, but they found my fingerprints on the murder weapon.

Mallory is thoughtful for a moment.

MALLORY

Do you have any idea who would want to frame you?

ANNA

No. That's why I need your help. I need you to find out who did this.

Mallory nods.

MALLORY

I'll do everything I can.

ANNA

Thank you, Mallory.

Mallory gets up from her desk and grabs her coat.

MALLORY

Let's go. We have a lot of work to do.
