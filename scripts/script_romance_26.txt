FADE IN:

EXT. PARIS - DAY

We see the skyline of Paris - the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, etc. We hear the sound of traffic and people talking.

Suddenly, we hear a woman screaming. We see a woman (FRANCOISE) running down the street, followed by a man (PIERRE). She is crying and he is shouting at her.

FRANCOISE:

(screaming)

Leave me alone! I hate you!

PIERRE:

(shouting)

You can't just leave me! We have a daughter!

 Francoise runs into a busy cafe and Pierre follows her.

FRANCOISE:

(to the café owner)

Help me! This man is following me!

The café owner calls the police.

PIERRE:

(to Francoise)

I'm not going to let you go! You're my wife!

The police arrive and Pierre is forced to leave.

EXT. PARIS STREET - DAY

We see Francoise walking down the street, looking sad and lost. She comes to a stop in front of a building. We see a man (JEAN) watching her from a window.

JEAN:

(voice-over)

I had been watching her for weeks. I knew she was unhappy. I could see it in the way she walked, the way she talked. I wanted to help her.

Jean comes down the stairs and approaches Francoise.

JEAN:

Excuse me, do you need help?

Francoise looks at him and then breaks down in tears.

FADE OUT.
