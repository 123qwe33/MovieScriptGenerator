FADE IN:

EXT. JENNA JAMESON'S HOUSE - DAY

Jenna Jameson is packing her bags, getting ready for a trip. She is moving slowly, her mind elsewhere.

JENNA

(to herself)

I can't believe she's gone.

She zips up her suitcase and looks around the room, taking in the memories.

JENNA

(to herself)

This was always her favorite room.

She takes a deep breath and picks up her suitcase, heading for the door.

CUT TO:

EXT. SHEPHERDSTOWN - DAY

Jenna's car pulls into town. She looks around, taking in the sights.

JENNA

(to herself)

So this is Shepherdstown.

She gets out of the car and stretches, looking around.

JENNA

(to herself)

It's so...quaint.

She starts to walk down the street, taking in the old buildings. She stops in front of The Shepherd's Bookshop.

JENNA

(to herself)

This looks like just the place to start.

She goes inside.

CUT TO:

INT. THE SHEPHERD'S BOOKSHOP - DAY

Jenna walks in and looks around. The store is full of books, and there is a warm feeling to the place.

JENNA

(to herself)

This is exactly what I need.

She starts to browse the shelves, looking for something to read.

MRS. SHEPHERD

Can I help you find something?

JENNA

(startled)

Oh, yes. I'm just looking for something to read.

MRS. SHEPHERD

Well, let me know if you need any help.

JENNA

Thank you.

She continues to browse, finally finding a book that catches her eye. She takes it to the counter.

MRS. SHEPHERD

Ah, The Shepherd's Bookshop. One of my favorites.

JENNA

It's a great book. I'm just looking for something to escape into.

MRS. SHEPHERD

I know how you feel.

JENNA

(paying for the book)

Thank you.

She starts to leave, but something catches her eye.

JENNA

(to Mrs. Shepherd)

What's that?

MRS. SHEPHERD

(following her gaze)

Oh, that's just the key to the secret room.

JENNA

(interested)

The secret room?

MRS. SHEPHERD

Yes, it's a room that's been hidden for many years. No one knows what's inside.

JENNA

(to herself)

This place just keeps getting better and better.

She looks at Mrs. Shepherd.

JENNA

Do you think I could see it?

MRS. SHEPHERD

(hesitant)

Well, I don't know...

JENNA

(pleading)

Please? I promise I won't tell anyone.

MRS. SHEPHERD

(giving in)

All right. But you have to promise to be careful.

JENNA

I promise.

Mrs. Shepherd leads her to the back of the store and unlocks the door to the secret room.

MRS. SHEPHERD

(to Jenna)

Be careful.

Jenna nods and goes into the room.

CUT TO:

INT. THE SHEPHERD'S BOOKSHOP - SECRET ROOM - DAY

Jenna looks around the room, taking in the dusty old books and furniture. She starts to look through some of the books, but she doesn't find anything interesting. She is about to leave when she sees something glinting in the corner. She walks over and picks up a journal.

JENNA

(to herself)

What's this?

She starts to flip through the journal, and her eyes widen in surprise.

JENNA

(to herself)

This is my grandmother's journal.

She starts to read, and the more she reads, the more interested she becomes.

JENNA
