FADE IN:

EXT. ARIONNA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A group of men clad in black approach a small house in the woods. They move quietly, careful not to make any noise.

One of the men, JACOB, knocks on the door.

A moment later, the door opens and a young woman, ARIONNA, stands in the doorway.

JACOB

We're here to take you with us, Arionna.

Arionna looks confused and scared.

ARIONNA

What? Who are you?

JACOB

We're here to help you. You've been chosen to take part in a sacred ritual.

Arionna starts to back away from the men.

ARIONNA

No, I don't want to go with you! Leave me alone!

JACOB

I'm sorry, but we can't do that. You must come with us.

Arionna tries to slam the door, but one of the men, SAMUEL, stops her.

SAMUEL

We mean you no harm, Arionna. But you must come with us. It's your destiny.

Arionna reluctantly agrees to go with the men. She has no idea what's in store for her.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

Arionna is led through the forest by Jacob and Samuel. She is still scared and confused.

JACOB

Don't be afraid, Arionna. We're here to help you.

ARIONNA

Help me? How?

JACOB

You've been chosen to take part in a sacred ritual. Once it's complete, you'll be able to commune with the spirit world.

ARIONNA

What? Why me?

JACOB

Because you're special. You have the power to save your people from a dark force that threatens to destroy them.

Arionna is still skeptical, but she decides to go along with the men.

EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT

Arionna is led into a clearing in the forest. In the center of the clearing is a stone altar.

JACOB

This is where the ritual will take place.

Arionna looks around, unsure of what to do.

JACOB

Don't be afraid. We'll be with you every step of the way.

Arionna takes a deep breath and nods. She is ready to begin her journey.
