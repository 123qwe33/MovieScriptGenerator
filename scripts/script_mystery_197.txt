FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Inspector Jakurai walks down the dark, deserted streets of the city, his trenchcoat flapping in the wind. He looks up at the night sky, his expression cynical and tired.

Suddenly, he hears a scream.

He breaks into a run, following the sound until he comes to a stop in an alleyway. There, he finds the body of a young woman, her throat slit.

Inspector Jakurai sighs and pulls out his notebook.

Just another day on the job.

FADE TO BLACK.
