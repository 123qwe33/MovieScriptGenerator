FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

A body lies in a pool of blood, its throat slit open. A crowd of onlookers

stands around the body, murmuring in shock.

DETECTIVE (O.S.)

Another one.

We see the detective, a tough-looking man in his forties, as he surveys the scene. He has a weary look in his eyes, as if he's seen this too many times before.

DETECTIVE

What is this city coming to?

He shakes his head and walks away, leaving the crowd to gawk at the

body.

FADE TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

The detective is sitting in a interrogation room, across from a

suspect. The suspect is a young man, who looks to be in his early

twenties. He's sweating and nervous, and he won't meet the detective's gaze.

DETECTIVE

So, you're telling me you didn't see anything?

SUSPECT

I didn't see nothing, I swear!

DETECTIVE

You sure about that?

The detective leans forward, his face inches from the suspect's.

DETECTIVE

Because if you did see something, and you're not telling me, I'll find out. And when I do, I'll make sure you regret it.

The suspect swallows hard and shakes his head.

SUSPECT

I didn't see nothing. I swear!

DETECTIVE

Alright, that's enough.

The detective gets up and leaves the room, slamming the door behind

him.

FADE TO:

INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

The detective is sitting in his office, going through some files. He

looks up as the door opens and a woman walks in. She's in her early

thirties, and she looks distraught.

WOMAN

I need your help.

DETECTIVE

What can I do for you?

WOMAN

My husband was killed last night. The police are doing everything they can, but I need someone who's going to find out who did this. I need closure.

DETECTIVE

I'll see what I can do.

WOMAN

Thank you.

The woman hands the detective a file and then leaves the office.

DETECTIVE

(to himself)

Another one.

He sighs and starts to go through the file.

FADE TO:

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

The detective is doing some research, looking through old newspaper

articles. He's muttering to himself as he reads.

DETECTIVE

What the hell is going on here?

He looks up as the librarian walks over to him.

LIBRARIAN

Can I help you find something?

DETECTIVE

Yeah, I'm looking for information on a string of murders that happened about twenty years ago.

LIBRARIAN

Let me see.

The librarian starts to look through the files. After a moment, she

finds what she's looking for.

LIBRARIAN

Here it is.

She hands the file to the detective and he starts to read through it.

DETECTIVE

So it's started again, has it?

LIBRARIAN

I'm sorry?

DETECTIVE

Nothing. Thank you for your help.

The detective gets up and leaves the library.

FADE TO:

INT. DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The detective is sitting at his desk, going through the files. He's

smoking a cigarette, and there's a look of determination in his eyes.

DETECTIVE

I'm going to catch this bastard if it's the last thing I do.
