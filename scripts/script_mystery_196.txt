FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

A young woman, AKIKO, walks quickly down a dark street. She looks over her shoulder nervously, as if she's being followed.

AKIKO

(to herself)

Just keep walking. You're almost there.

She turns a corner and comes to a stop in front of a run-down apartment building. She takes a key out of her pocket and unlocks the door.

AKIKO

(to herself)

Home sweet home.

She steps inside and closes the door behind her. We can hear the sound of someone following her. The door slams shut and the sound of footsteps fades into the distance.

AKIKO

(to herself)

That was close.

She takes a deep breath and starts to relax, but suddenly her phone starts to ring.

AKIKO

(to herself)

Shit.

She pulls out her phone and sees that the caller ID says "Private Investigator." She hesitates for a moment, but then decides to answer.

AKIKO

(into phone)

Hello?

PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR

(on the other end)

Akiko, we need to talk.
