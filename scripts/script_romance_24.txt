FADE IN:

EXT. PARIS SUBWAY STATION - DAY

Paul (20s) exits the subway, looking lost and out of sorts. He's wearing wrinkled clothes and has dark circles under his eyes. He wanders around the station, not sure where to go.

Suddenly, he notices a beautiful woman (Juliette, 20s) across the platform. She's talking on the phone and seems to be in a hurry. Paul is instantly smitten and can't take his eyes off her.

He starts following her as she leaves the station and weaves through the busy streets of Paris. She doesn't seem to notice him.

PAUL

(to himself)

Who is she?

He follows her into a cafe and sits down at a table nearby, pretending to read a book. He steals glances at her as she talks on the phone and sips her coffee.

PAUL

(to himself)

She's so beautiful. I have to talk to her.

He gets up the courage to approach her.

PAUL

Excuse me, do you have the time?

Juliette looks up at him, surprised.

JULIETTE

Oh, um, it's quarter to three.

PAUL

Thank you.

He starts to walk away, but then turns back.

PAUL

I'm sorry, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation. Are you an actress?

JULIETTE

Yes, I am.

PAUL

That's amazing. I've always wanted to be an actor.

JULIETTE

Really? What's stopping you?

PAUL

I don't know. I guess I just never had the courage to go for it.

JULIETTE

That's how I felt when I first started out. But you have to go for it, or you'll regret it forever.

PAUL

I guess you're right.

JULIETTE

Anyway, I should go. It was nice meeting you.

PAUL

Yeah, you too.

He watches her leave, feeling hopeful for the first time in a long time.
