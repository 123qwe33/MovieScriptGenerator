FADE IN:

EXT. LAND OF ETERNAL NIGHT - DAWN

A dense fog hangs over the land, obscuring everything in a eerie white mist.

Suddenly, a loud BOOM echoes through the fog, followed by the sound of screams.

The mist begins to clear, revealing a group of REBELS running through the woods, pursued by a group of SOLDIERS on horseback.

The REBELS are led by a skilled WARRIOR, who fights with the strength and precision of a seasoned fighter.

The SOLDIERS are armed with swords and crossbows, and they ride ruthlessly through the woods, cutting down any REBEL who gets in their way.

The WARRIOR knows that the SOLDIERS are closing in on them.

He turns to his fellow REBELS and shouts:

WARRIOR

We need to find shelter! Follow me!

The WARRIOR leads the REBELS through the woods, evading the SOLDIERS.

Suddenly, the ground gives way beneath them and they fall into a dark cave.

The REBELS land in a heap at the bottom of the cave, surrounded by darkness.

The WARRIOR stands up and looks around, trying to get his bearings.

He knows that the SOLDIERS will not rest until they have captured or killed the REBELS.

The WARRIOR turns to his fellow REBELS and says:

WARRIOR

We're not safe here. We need to keep moving.

The REBELS nod in agreement and follow the WARRIOR deeper into the cave.

As they move through the darkness, they are unaware of the dangers that lurk in the shadows, ready to strike...
