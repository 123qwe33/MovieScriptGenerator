FADE IN:

EXT. GALLIONE - DAY

The sun shines down on the bustling city of Gallione. The streets are busy with people going about their day.

Suddenly, a group of armed men come running down the street. They are followed closely by a second group of men, also armed.

The two groups begin to fight in the street. People scatter as the men clash.

Ramza Beoulve, a young man of 20, watches from a nearby alleyway. He is unarmed.

Suddenly, one of the men breaks away from the fight and comes running towards Ramza. The man is being pursued by two of the other men.

Ramza tries to run, but the man grabs him, begging for help.

The two men catch up to the man and begin to beat him. Ramza tries to fight them off, but he is outnumbered and outmatched.

Suddenly, a third man appears. He quickly dispatches the two attackers and helps the man to his feet.

The man introduces himself as Delita Heiral. He tells Ramza that he is also a fugitive and asks if he can join forces with him.

Ramza agrees and the two men set off together.

FADE TO BLACK.
