FADE IN:

EXT. ROCKSVILLE - DAY

A small, sleepy town in the middle of nowhere.

JOSIE (20s) drives down the main street, looking around with a mix of curiosity and trepidation.

JOSIE
This is it. Grandpa's house is just down this road.

She turns down a side street and pulls up in front of a dilapidated old house.

JOSIE
(sighing)
Well, here goes nothing.

She gets out of the car and starts towards the house, when she's suddenly accosted by a woman who comes running up to her, out of breath.

GLADYS
You must be Josie! I'm Gladys, your next door neighbor.

JOSIE
(surprised)
Oh, um, hi. Nice to meet you.

GLADYS
(breathless)
I saw you drive up and I just had to come over and introduce myself. I'm the town busybody, so if you need to know anything, just come to me.

JOSIE
(smiling)
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

GLADYS
So, what brings you to Rocksville?

JOSIE
I inherited this house from my grandfather. I'm going to renovate it and flip it for a profit.

GLADYS
(disapprovingly)
That old house? You'll never make a profit on that place. It's been empty for years. And it's said to be cursed.

JOSIE
(laughs)
A curse? That's a new one. I've heard it all now.

GLADYS
No, I'm serious. The previous owner, Mrs. Wilkinson, died under suspicious circumstances. Some say she was murdered.

JOSIE
(intrigued)
Really? What happened to her?

GLADYS
Nobody knows for sure. Her body was found at the bottom of the stairs. But there was no sign of forced entry and nothing was stolen, so the police ruled it an accident. But some of us in town think she was pushed.

JOSIE
(smiling)
Well, I'm not superstitious, so I'm not going to let a little thing like a curse stop me. I'm going to renovate this house if it's the last thing I do.

GLADYS
(shaking her head)
I don't know why you're bothering. But if you're determined to do it, I'll help you. I know everybody in town and I can tell you all the gossip.

JOSIE
(laughs)
Gossip? That's exactly what I need. Thanks, Gladys.

GLADYS
(smiling)
Don't mention it. Now, let's go inside and have a look around.

JOSIE
(nods)
Okay.

They head towards the house.

FADE OUT.
