FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - OUR SOLAR SYSTEM

The planets in our solar system orbit the sun. There are no signs of life.

Suddenly, a large alien vessel appears. It is much bigger than anything we have ever seen before.

The vessel sends a transmission to all of the colonies.

ALIEN VOICE

We come in peace. We invite you to join us on a journey to explore the universe.

The humans are hesitant at first, but eventually they agree to go on the journey.

INT. ALIEN VESSEL

The humans are amazed by the ship and the aliensâ€™ technology.

ALIEN

We are also searching for other intelligent life forms. We have been doing this for many centuries.

The humans and aliens become friends and explore the universe together. They have many adventures and learn about different cultures. They also help each other out when they are in danger.

Eventually, the humans find a planet that is suitable for them to colonize. They say goodbye to the aliens and start their new lives on this planet.

THE END
