FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - NEARBY GALAXY

A space shuttle is making its way through a nearby galaxy. On board are a team of scientists, who are on a mission to investigate a strange anomaly.

As they approach the anomaly, they find a planet that is entirely uninhabitable. The atmosphere is toxic and the surface is incredibly hot.

However, they also find a strange creature that seems to be immune to the conditions of the planet. The team must find out what this creature is and how it is able to survive in such a hostile environment.

FADE TO BLACK.
