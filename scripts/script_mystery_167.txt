FADE IN:

EXT. VICTORIAN HOUSE - DAY

We see a beautiful old Victorian house. It is surrounded by a white picket fence and has a large porch with a swing. We hear the sound of a car pulling up.

PENELOPE (voice-over): This is the house my Aunt Harriet left me. I'd never even met her. But when she died, she left me this house.

We see a young woman, PENELOPE PETERS, getting out of a car. She is in her early twenties and is very pretty. She is carrying a suitcase.

PENELOPE (voice-over): I came here to see what I had inherited. I had no idea what I was getting myself into.

Penelope walks up to the house and unlocks the door. She steps inside.

PENELOPE (voice-over): The first thing I noticed was the smell. It was musty and old. But it was also kind of...pleasant.

Penelope looks around the house. It is very old and dusty, but it is also very beautiful.

PENELOPE (voice-over): I could tell that the house had been empty for a long time. But there was something about it that made me feel at home.

Penelope starts to explore the house. She goes into the living room and looks around. Then she notices a picture on the wall. It is a picture of a woman who looks a lot like her.

PENELOPE: This must be Aunt Harriet.

Penelope looks at the picture for a moment, then she hears a noise coming from upstairs. She goes to investigate.

PENELOPE (voice-over): I didn't know what to expect when I came here. But I definitely didn't expect to find a dead body.

We see Penelope walking up the stairs. She is holding her suitcase in one hand and the picture in the other. She looks scared.

PENELOPE (voice-over): The body was of a woman. She was old and she was wearing a nightgown. I didn't know who she was. But I knew I had to call the police.

Penelope goes into the room where the body is and puts down her suitcase. She takes out her phone and starts to dial 911.
