FADE IN:

EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

The body of a young woman lies in a pool of blood, her eyes wide open in a silent scream. Detective Shinya Kazama kneels down next to her, his face grim.

KAZAMA

(to himself)

Another one.

He looks up as Detective Ayumu Mikami approaches, shaking his head.

MIKAMI

This is getting out of hand.

KAZAMA

(stands up)

Tell me about it.

He looks around the alleyway, his eyes scanning for any clues.

KAZAMA

What do we have?

MIKAMI

Not much. No witnesses, no cameras, nothing.

KAZAMA

(sighs)

Alright, let's get to work then.

They both get to work, searching for any clues that might help them solve the case. But it quickly becomes clear that this is no ordinary murder...
