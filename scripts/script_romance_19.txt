FADE IN:

EXT. SMALL TOWN IN SOUTH OF FRANCE - DAY

We see a small town in the south of France. The sun is shining and the people are going about their day.

We see PAUL, a young man in his early twenties. He is the son of the town's mayor. He is handsome and well-liked by the townspeople.

We see JULIETTE, a young woman in her early twenties. She is the daughter of the town's priest. She is beautiful and innocent.

Paul and Juliette meet each other's eyes and they instantly fall in love.

JULIETTE

(smiling)

Hello, Paul.

PAUL

(smiling)

Hello, Juliette.

They both know that they are not supposed to be together. Their families would never approve.

PAUL

(whispering)

I'll meet you tonight.

JULIETTE

(whispering)

I'll be waiting.

They both smile and go their separate ways.

FADE TO:

EXT. FOREST OUTSIDE OF TOWN - NIGHT

Paul and Juliette meet each other in the forest outside of town. They are both excited to see each other.

JULIETTE

(smiling)

I've missed you.

PAUL

(smiling)

I've missed you too.

They kiss each other passionately. They are deeply in love.

PAUL

(whispering)

I love you, Juliette.

JULIETTE

(whispering)

I love you too, Paul.

Suddenly, they hear someone coming. They quickly pull away from each other.

JULIETTE'S FATHER

(yelling)

Juliette!

They both look at each other in terror. They know they have been caught.

FADE TO:

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

Paul and Juliette are in the town square, surrounded by the townspeople. Paul's father, the mayor, is there, as well as Juliette's father, the priest.

Both fathers are outraged. They forbid their children from seeing each other ever again.

PAUL'S FATHER

(yelling)

You are not to see each other again! Do you understand me?

JULIETTE'S FATHER

(yelling)

This is unacceptable! You are both to stay away from each other!

Paul and Juliette look at each other with sadness and determination. They know they will find a way to be together again.
