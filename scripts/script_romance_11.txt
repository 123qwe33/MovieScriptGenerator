FADE IN:

EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY

We see a beautiful mountain range, with snow-capped peaks and pristine forests.

Suddenly, we hear a woman's voice, yelling in frustration.

CUT TO:

EXT. HIKING TRAIL - DAY

We see a woman, JENNIFER, in her late 30s, struggling to hike up a steep trail. She's obviously out of her element, and she's getting angry.

JENNIFER

(yelling)

This is ridiculous! I can't believe I let myself be talked into this.

She stops to catch her breath, and that's when she sees him. He's a handsome man in his early 40s, wearing hiking gear. He's coming down the trail, and he looks like he knows what he's doing.

JENNIFER

(to herself)

Well, at least I won't be the only one lost if we get lost.

She starts to hike again, and he falls into step beside her.

MAN

You looked like you could use some help.

JENNIFER

(slightly embarrassed)

Yeah, I'm not exactly used to this. I'm Jennifer, by the way.

MAN

I'm Alex. It's nice to meet you.

JENNIFER

Likewise.

They hike in silence for a few minutes.

JENNIFER

(looking around)

So, um, do you come here often?

MAN

(chuckling)

Yeah, I guess you could say that. I'm a park ranger.

JENNIFER

(surprised)

Really? I would have never guessed.

MAN

What, that I'm a park ranger?

JENNIFER

No, that you're the kind of person who would enjoy this. I mean, you don't exactly look like the outdoorsy type.

MAN

(smiling)

I'm not sure what you mean by that, but I'll take it as a compliment.

She smiles back at him, and they continue hiking.
