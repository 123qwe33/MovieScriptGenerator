FADE IN:

EXT. ITALIAN STREET - DAY

Mallory (late 20s) walks down a busy street in Rome, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. She looks sad and lost.

Suddenly, she stops in front of a café and has a sudden urge to go inside.

INT. CAFÉ - DAY

Mallory sits down at a table and orders a coffee. She looks around the café and notices a handsome man sitting at the counter. She can't help but stare at him.

The man, Luca (late 20s), notices her staring and smiles at her.

Mallory looks away, embarrassed.

Luca gets up from his seat and walks over to her.

LUCAS

Excuse me, do you speak English?

MALLORY

Yes, I do.

LUCAS

I couldn't help but notice you were staring at me. I'm Luca.

MALLORY

I'm Mallory.

Luca sits down in the seat across from her.

LUCAS

So, what brings you to Rome?

MALLORY

My best friend died a few weeks ago and I needed to get away. This was the one place she loved most in the world, so I thought it might help me to feel closer to her.

LUCAS

I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my best friend a few years ago and I know how hard it can be.

MALLORY

Thank you. It's nice to meet someone who understands.

Luca and Mallory spend the next few days exploring Rome together. They quickly fall in love with each other and the city.

On the day she is leaving, Luca walks her to the train station.

LUCAS

I'm going to miss you, Mallory.

MALLORY

I'm going to miss you too, Luca. But I know we'll see each other again someday.

They share a long hug and a kiss goodbye.

MALLORY (CONT'D)

I'll see you soon.

LUCAS

I hope so.

Mallory boards her train and waves to Luca as it pulls away.

FADE OUT.
