FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - THE PROVIDENCE

The Providence is a large starship, travelling through deep space. It's been many years since the ship set out on its journey, and the crew is tired and battered. But they're still hopeful that they'll find a new home.

Suddenly, the ship's alarms begin to sound. The crew is on high alert, unsure of what's happening.

INT. PROVIDENCE - BRIDGE

CAPTAIN JAMESON is in the captain's chair, surrounded by his crew. They're all looking at the viewscreen, which is showing a strange alien ship.

CAPTAIN JAMESON

What the hell is that thing?

CREW MEMBER

I have no idea, sir.

CAPTAIN JAMESON

Well, whatever it is, it's heading right for us.

The alien ship gets closer and closer, until it's right next to the Providence.

CAPTAIN JAMESON

What do they want?

Suddenly, the alien ship opens fire on the Providence. The crew is caught off guard and they start to panic.

CAPTAIN JAMESON

Return fire!

The crew starts to fight back, but it's clear that they're outmatched. The alien ship is too powerful and the Providence is taking heavy damage.

CAPTAIN JAMESON

We need to retreat!

The crew starts to evacuate the ship, but it's too late. The Providence is destroyed in a massive explosion.

FADE TO BLACK.
