FADE IN:

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

JENNA walks to her car, ready to go home after a long day of work. She notices a tall, handsome stranger watching her from across the parking lot. Jenna feels a deep connection to the stranger and can't help but approach him.

JENNA

Hi, I'm Jenna.

HUNTER

Hi, I'm Hunter.

JENNA

It's nice to meet you.

HUNTER

You too.

JENNA

Do you work here?

HUNTER

No, I was just in the area and saw you. I thought you were really beautiful, so I wanted to say hi.

JENNA

That's so sweet. I'm flattered.

HUNTER

So, what do you do?

JENNA

I'm an accountant.

HUNTER

That's fascinating. I'm a writer.

JENNA

Really? What do you write?

HUNTER

 mostly fiction, but I've been dabbling in screenplays lately.

JENNA

That's so cool. I've always wanted to write a book.

HUNTER

Maybe we can collaborate sometime.

JENNA

I'd love that.

They spend the rest of the night talking and soon realize they are soulmates.

JENNA

I can't believe how much we have in common. It's like we were meant to be together.

HUNTER

I know. I feel the same way.

JENNA

This is so surreal.

HUNTER

I know. But it feels so right.

JENNA

I know.

They stare into each others' eyes, realizing they have found the love of their life.

HUNTER

Jenna, will you go on a date with me this weekend?

JENNA

I would love to.

HUNTER

Great. I'll pick you up at 7:00 on Saturday.

JENNA

I'll be waiting.

They smile and go their separate ways, looking forward to their date this weekend.
