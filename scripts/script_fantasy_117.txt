INT. DARIEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

DARIEN (20) is packing a bag. He is moving quickly and with purpose.

DARIEN

(to himself)

They'll be coming for me soon. I have to go.

He finishes packing and picks up his sword. He heads for the door.

DARIEN'S MOTHER (O.S.)

Darien, where are you going?

DARIEN stops. He doesn't want to lie to his mother, but he knows he has to.

DARIEN

I have to go away for a while. I'll be back, I promise.

DARIEN'S MOTHER

(voice breaking)

You can't go! You're the only one left!

DARIEN

(gently)

I know, Mother. But I have to go.

He gives her a hug, then starts to leave.

DARIEN'S MOTHER

(crying)

Please, Darien! Don't go!

DARIEN doesn't look back. He knows if he does, he won't be able to leave.

EXT. DARIEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

DARIEN sneaks out of the house and runs into the woods. He knows he has to put as much distance between himself and his pursuers as possible.

He doesn't know where he's going, but he knows he has to keep moving.

FADE OUT.
