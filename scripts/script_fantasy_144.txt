FADE IN:

EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

A bloody battle is raging. Two armies are clashing, and the sound of swords and shields ringing is deafening. The ground is littered with bodies, and the air is thick with the smell of blood and death.

In the midst of the chaos, one figure stands out. He is a massive man, clad in armor from head to toe. He wields a huge sword, and he cuts down anyone who comes near him. He is the warlord, and he is invincible.

The warlord's enemies are closing in on him, but he doesn't seem to care. He knows that he is the strongest, and that no one can defeat him.

Suddenly, a arrow whizzes by his head, narrowly missing him. The warlord knows that his enemies are getting desperate, but he is not afraid. He will not be defeated.

FADE OUT.
