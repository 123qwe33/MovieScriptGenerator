FADE IN:

EXT. JAPANESE CITY - NIGHT

We see a busy cityscape at night, with bright lights and busy streets. We hear the sound of car horns and busy traffic.

Suddenly, we hear a woman screaming. We see a woman running down the street, pursued by a man in a dark coat. The woman is terrified, and the man is gaining on her.

Just as the man is about to catch the woman, she stumbles and falls to the ground. The man catches up to her, and we see that he has a knife in his hand.

The woman screams as the man stabs her to death.

We hear sirens in the distance, and the man runs away.

FADE TO BLACK.
