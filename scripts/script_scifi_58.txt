FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - THE SOLAR SYSTEM

The camera pans across the vast expanse of the solar system. We see the inner planets - Mercury, Venus, and Earth - which are now uninhabitable. The camera then moves out to Mars, which is the only habitable planet. The majority of the human population now lives here.

INT. MARS COLONY - REBEL BASE

We see a group of rebel scientists working in a secret laboratory. They are trying to find a way to terraform the inner planets so that they can be inhabitable again.

LEAD SCIENTIST

We've been working on this for years, but we're no closer to a solution.

SECOND SCIENTIST

The government is getting closer and closer to finding us. We need to find a way to terraform the inner planets before they catch us.

LEAD SCIENTIST

We'll never be able to do it without their help.

The scientists continue to work, but they are clearly getting frustrated.

THIRD SCIENTIST

There has to be a way. We can't give up.

Suddenly, they are interrupted by a loud alarm.

LEAD SCIENTIST

They're here!

The scientists quickly gather their things and flee the laboratory. They are pursued by a group of government agents.

FEDERAL AGENT

Stop! You're under arrest!

The scientists ignore them and continue to run. They are quickly losing the agents, but they know that they won't be able to hide for long.

LEAD SCIENTIST

We need to find a way to get to the inner planets. If we can terraform them, the government will be forced to step down and the people will be able to live in peace.

The scientists continue to run, but they know that they are running out of time.
