FADE IN:

EXT. SMALL VILLAGE IN A REMOTE PART OF THE KINGDOM - DAY

Sage, a young woman, is walking through the village. She looks around at her home with a longing expression.

SAGE
 There has to be more to life than this.

She walks past the other villagers, who all seem content with their lives.

SAGE
 (cont'd)
 I want to have adventures. I want to explore the world.

Suddenly, she notices a book lying on the ground. She picks it up and looks at it curiously.

SAGE
 (cont'd)
 What's this?

She opens the book and starts to read.

SAGE
 (cont'd)
 "Once upon a time, there was a great kingdom... "

Fascinated, she continues to read.

CUT TO:

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Sage is walking through the forest, looking for her friends.

SAGE
 Guys, where are you?

Suddenly, she hears a noise. She turns around and sees a creature lurking in the shadows.

SAGE
 (cont'd)
 Aah!

She runs away from the creature, but it follows her. She runs faster, but it's gaining on her.

SAGE
 (cont'd)
 Help!

Just as the creature is about to catch her, she's rescued by her friends.

FRIEND #1
 Are you okay?

SAGE
 Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for saving me.

FRIEND #2
 What was that thing?

SAGE
 I don't know, but we should get out of here before it comes back.

They start to run, but they're quickly surrounded by more of the creatures.

FRIEND #1
 What do we do now?

SAGE
 I don't know.

FRIEND #2
 We're going to die!

Just then, they're saved by a group of soldiers.

SOLDIER #1
 Come with us. We'll take you to safety.

SAGE
 Thank you.

They're escorted out of the forest and back to the village.

CUT TO:

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Sage is talking to the soldiers.

SAGE
 So these creatures have been attacking villages all over the kingdom?

SOLDIER #1
 Yes. We don't know what they are or where they came from.

SAGE
 And the king? What does he say?

SOLDIER #1
 He's offered a large bounty for anyone who can kill the creatures.

SAGE
 I see.

SOLDIER #1
 But it's too dangerous. We advise everyone to stay in their homes.

SAGE
 I understand. Thank you for your help.

The soldiers leave and Sage goes back to her home.

CUT TO:

EXT. SAGE'S HOME - DAY

Sage is inside her home, packing her bags.

SAGE
 I have to find this kingdom. I have to help these people.

She finishes packing and goes outside.

CUT TO:

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Sage is saying goodbye to her friends.

SAGE
 I have to do this.

FRIEND #1
 Be careful.

SAGE
 I will.

She starts to walk away, but she's stopped by her friend.

FRIEND #2
 Wait! Take this with you.

He gives her a sword.

SAGE
 Thank you.

She takes the sword and starts to walk away again.

FRIEND #1
 Good luck!

SAGE
 Thanks. I'll need it.

She starts to walk down the road, towards the kingdom.

FADE OUT.
