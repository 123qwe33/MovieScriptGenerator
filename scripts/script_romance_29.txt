A small, but cozy apartment. CAMILLE, 21, is packing her bags.

CAMILLE (V.O.)

I always dreamed of living here. Of working in a high-powered job and rubbing elbows with the rich and famous.

CAMILLE'S MOTHER enters the room.

CAMILLE'S MOTHER

Are you sure you're ready for this, Camille? It's a big step.

CAMILLE

I'm ready, Mama. I've been ready for this my whole life.

CAMILLE'S MOTHER

(sighs)

I just don't want you to get hurt.

CAMILLE

I won't, Mama. I promise.

CAMILLE'S MOTHER gives her a hug.

CAMILLE'S MOTHER

I know you're going to do great things, Camille. I'm so proud of you.

CAMILLE

(smiles)

Thank you, Mama.

CAMILLE'S MOTHER exits the room. CAMILLE finishes packing her bags and looks around the apartment one last time.

This is it. The beginning of my new life.

You must be Camille.

Welcome to the team. I'm sure you're going to be a great asset to us.

Thank you, sir. I'm looking forward to getting started.

JEAN-CLAUDE shows CAMILLE to her desk.

JEAN-CLAUDE

Your first assignment is to work on a project with our newest client, Olivier. He's a bit of a maverick, but he's very successful. I think you'll be able to learn a lot from him.

CAMILLE

(in French)

I'm looking forward to it, sir.

JEAN-CLAUDE

(in French)

Good. I'll let him know you're here.

This is it. The first day of the rest of my life.
