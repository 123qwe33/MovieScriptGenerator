FADE IN:

EXT. DARK, GRUNGY CITY - NIGHT

The city is filled with crime and corruption. The streets are dirty and the buildings are run-down.

Hard-boiled detective JOHN DOE is walking down the street, looking frustrated. He's been working on a case that seems impossible to solve.

JOHN

(to himself)

This case is driving me crazy. I can't seem to find any clues that make sense.

Suddenly, JOHN's phone rings. He answers it.

JOHN

(into phone)

Hello?

VOICE ON THE OTHER END

(on the phone)

John, I've got some information on your case.

JOHN

(into phone)

Really? What is it?

VOICE ON THE OTHER END

(on the phone)

I think I know who did it.

JOHN

(into phone)

That's great! Who is it?

VOICE ON THE OTHER END

(on the phone)

I'll tell you when I see you. Meet me at the usual place in an hour.

JOHN

(into phone)

OK, I'll be there.

JOHN hangs up the phone and starts to walk away.

JOHN

(to himself)

Finally, a new lead. Maybe this case is about to get interesting.
