FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - A vast and empty void

A small ship comes into view, zipping through the emptiness. It's the pirate ship, the Starlight.

PAN TO:

INT. STARLIGHT - COCKPIT

Captain Nova Star is at the controls, her right hand on the steering wheel. Her first mate, Jax, is next to her, manning the guns.

NOVA:

Come on, Jax. We're almost there.

JAX:

Aye, Captain.

NOVA:

I can't believe we're actually going to do this.

JAX:

We've been planning this for years. It's finally happening.

NOVA:

I know. I just hope we're ready.

JAX:

We're ready, Captain.

NOVA:

I hope you're right.

Suddenly, the ship is rocked by a blast.

NOVA:

What the hell was that?

JAX:

I don't know, but we're under attack!
