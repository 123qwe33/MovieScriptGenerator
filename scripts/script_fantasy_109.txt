INT. CASTLE THRONE ROOM - DAY King Amarr sits on his throne, surrounded by his advisors. Darrak, the evil wizard, stands before him, whispering in his ear. Amarr's face is blank, his eyes glassy. Darrak has taken control of his mind. 

DARRAK
(whispering)
You must wage war on the kingdom of Zalar. Destroy them all.

King Amarr nods obediently. Darrak cackles with glee.

DARRAK
(to the advisors)
The king has spoken. Prepare for war.

The advisors bow and hurry off to do Darrak's bidding. Darrak turns to the king with a satisfied smirk.

DARRAK
(to the king)
Now, my liege. You will do as I say.

FADE TO BLACK.

INT. FOREST OF SHADOWS - DAY Princess Leilanil rides through the forest of Shadows on her trusty steed. She has been banished here by her father, at Darrak's request. 

Suddenly, she hears a rustling in the bushes. An arrow whizzes by her head and lodges itself in a tree. Leilanil draws her sword and prepares to fight.

A group of bandits steps out from behind the trees, brandishing their weapons. Lebanil charges at them, swinging her sword wildly. After a fierce battle, she emerges victorious. The bandits lie dead at her feet.

LENA
(to herself)
I have to get back to the castle. Darrak is controlling my father and waging war on Zalar. I'm the only one who can stop him.

She climbs back on her horse and continues her journey.

FADE TO BLACK.

INT. CASTLE THRONE ROOM - DAY King Amarr sits on his throne, surrounded by his advisors. Darrak, the evil wizard, stands before him, whispering in his ear. Princess Leilanil bursts into the room, sword drawn.

LENA
(to Darrak)
Release my father, you evil wizard!

Darrak turns to face her, an evil grin on his face.

DARRAK
(to the king)
Kill her, my liege.

King Amarr draws his sword and starts towards Leilanil. Darrak cackles with glee.

LENA
(to Darrak)
I'll never let you get away with this!

She charges at Darrak, sword raised. Darrak casts a spell, sending her flying backwards. She hits the wall hard and falls to the ground.

Darrak turns back to the king and starts to whisper in his ear again. Leilanil gets back to her feet and charges at Darrak again. This time, she's ready for his spells. She deflects them and keeps coming.

She finally reaches Darrak and plunges her sword into his heart. He falls to the ground, dead. The king falls to his knees, gasping for breath. Darrak's spell is broken.

Lena helps her father back to his feet. The advisors bow to her.

LENA
(to the advisors)
Prepare for peace. Zalar will not be destroyed.

FADE TO BLACK.
