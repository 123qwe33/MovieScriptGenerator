FADE IN:

EXT. NAINA'S VILLAGE - DAY

We see a small village in the middle of nowhere. There is a dirt road leading up to it.

We see a young girl, NAINA, walking down the road. She is carrying a few belongings with her.

NAINA

(to herself)

This is it. I'm finally going to the city. I'm going to make a better life for myself and my family.

We see NAINA's family waving to her from their doorstep.

FAMILY

(shouting)

Goodbye, Naina! We'll miss you!

NAINA

(shouting)

I'll miss you too! But I'll be back soon. I promise.

NAINA keeps walking until she reaches the edge of the village. She takes one last look at her home and then starts walking down the road.

FADE OUT.
