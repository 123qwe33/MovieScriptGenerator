FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

A dark and seedy city. We hear the sound of sirens in the distance.

We see a body lying in an alleyway, mutilated beyond recognition.

A police officer kneels down next to the body, shining a flashlight on it.

POLICE OFFICER

What the hell happened here?

FADE TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

A busy police station. We see detectives talking on the phone, typing on computers.

In the center of the room is a large bulletin board covered in photos and notes.

We see a detective, our detective, sitting at his desk, looking at the bulletin board. He looks tired, world-weary.

He gets up from his desk and walks over to the bulletin board. He looks at the photo of the mutilated body.

DETECTIVE

(to himself)

Who did this?

He looks at the other photos on the bulletin board.

DETECTIVE

(to himself)

No leads, no suspects. This one's gonna be tough.

He walks back to his desk and sits down. He looks at the photo of the body again.

DETECTIVE

(to himself)

Against my better judgement, I'm taking this case.

FADE TO:

INT. SEEDY NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

A dark and seedy nightclub. We hear the sound of music and laughter.

We see the detective, looking out of place in his suit and tie. He walks through the club, looking around.

He sees a woman sitting at the bar, nursing a drink. He walks over to her.

DETECTIVE

Excuse me, miss. I'm looking for information on a friend of hers.

WOMAN

(sighing)

Who are you?

DETECTIVE

I'm a detective.

WOMAN

(skeptical)

A detective?

DETECTIVE

That's right. I'm investigating the murder of a young woman. I was told that she was last seen with a friend of yours.

WOMAN

(sighing)

What was her name?

DETECTIVE

(showing her a photo)

Do you recognize her?

WOMAN

(looking at the photo)

Yes, that's my friend, Lily.

DETECTIVE

Do you know where I can find her?

WOMAN

(sighing)

She's dead.

DETECTIVE

(surprised)

What?

WOMAN

(sighing)

Lily is dead. She was killed last night.

DETECTIVE

(somber)

I'm sorry to hear that.

WOMAN

(sighing)

Lily was involved with a dangerous man. A man who is now after me.

DETECTIVE

(intrigued)

Do you know who this man is?

WOMAN

(sighing)

No, but I know that he's dangerous. He's going to kill me if he finds me.

DETECTIVE

(to himself)

I need to find this man before he finds her.

He gets up from his desk and walks over to the bulletin board. He looks at the photo of the mutilated body.

DETECTIVE

Whoever did this is a sick bastard.

He looks at the other photos on the bulletin board.
