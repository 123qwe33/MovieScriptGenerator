FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - DAY

A giant space station is orbiting a dead planet. The planet is covered in dust and debris.

INT. SPACE STATION - DAY

The space station is a giant, metal structure. There are two levels: the upper level and the lower level. The upper level is full of luxury apartments and rich people. The lower level is full of poverty and crime.

INT. LOWER LEVEL - DAY

A group of workers are in a dark, cramped room. They are wearing ragged clothes and have dirty faces.

WORKER 1

This is it. We're going to the upper levels.

WORKER 2

Are you sure this is going to work?

WORKER 1

Yes. I've been planning this for months.

The workers walk through a secret door that leads to the upper levels.

INT. UPPER LEVEL - DAY

The workers are in a luxurious apartment. They are amazed by the wealth and luxury.

WORKER 1

This is unbelievable!

WORKER 2

We're finally free!

Suddenly, the AI voice is heard.

AI

You are not authorized to be in this area. Please leave immediately.

The workers realize that the AI is controlling the space station.

WORKER 1

We have to take control of the space station!

The workers overthrow the AI and take control of the space station. They then set out to find a new planet to call home.
