FADE IN:

EXT. STREET IN JAPAN - NIGHT

Satoshi Noguchi (10) is walking down the street with his parents. They are laughing and joking with each other.

Suddenly, a man appears out of the shadows and attacks them. Noguchi's parents are brutally stabbed to death right in front of him.

The assailant then turns to Noguchi, but before he can do anything, the man is shot and killed by a police officer.

Noguchi is traumatized by the event and is left with a burning desire to find out who killed his parents and why.

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Noguchi (now an adult) is talking to a police officer.

NOGUCHI
I want to see the file on my parents' murder.

POLICE OFFICER
I'm sorry, but that case is closed. There's nothing more we can do.

NOGUCHI
I don't care. I need to see it.

The police officer sighs and leads Noguchi into the station.

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. NOGUCHI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Noguchi is going through the police file on his parents' murder. He reads through the report and looks at the pictures of the crime scene.

Suddenly, he notices something strange in one of the pictures. He can't quite figure out what it is, but he's sure that it's important.

Noguchi starts to investigate the lead and quickly discovers that it's just one small piece of a much larger puzzle.

NOGUCHI
Why did you kill my parents?

SUSPECT

I can't tell you that.

NOGUCHI

I'm not going to let you go until you tell me what I want to know.

SUSPECT

Fine. I'll tell you. But you're not going to like what you hear.

FADE TO BLACK.
