FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - THE ISS ENTERPRISE

The ISS Enterprise is a giant space station, floating through the vast emptiness of space. It's crewed by the best and the brightest of humanity, and they're on a mission to explore the unknown.

Suddenly, the Enterprise comes across an alien species, the Malakim. The Malakim are a warlike people, and they want the Enterprise for themselves.

The crew of the Enterprise must find a way to warn Earth of the impending invasion, and stop the Malakim before they can reach Mars. But they'll have to fight tooth and nail to do it. It'll be the fight of their lives.

FADE TO BLACK.
