FADE IN:

EXT. SMALL TOWN - DAY

Delia (30s) walks down the street, a stack of books in her arms. She nods and smiles at the people she passes, stopping to chat with some of them.

Delia: Hi, Mrs. Saunders. How are you today?

Mrs. Saunders: Oh, I'm just fine, Delia. And how are you?

Delia: I'm good. Just headed to the library.

Mrs. Saunders: You love those books, don't you, dear?

Delia: More than anything.

Delia continues on her way, humming to herself.

CUT TO:

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Delia walks through the library, greeting the people she sees. She waves to the librarian at the front desk as she goes to her office in the back.

Delia: Hi, Mrs. Johnson.

Mrs. Johnson: Hi, Delia. You're looking at books again, I see.

Delia: Of course. What else would I be doing in a library?

Mrs. Johnson: You're such a bookworm.

Delia: I can't help it. I love books.

Delia enters her office and puts the books down on her desk. She sits down and starts to look through them, when she notices something strange. There's a book on her desk that she doesn't remember putting there. She picks it up and starts to leaf through it, when she notices a piece of paper sticking out of the pages. She pulls it out and reads it, her eyes widening in shock.

Delia: "If you want to know who killed me, look in the book."

CUT TO:

INT. DELIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Delia is sitting at her kitchen table, a cup of tea in front of her. She's looking at the piece of paper again, her brow furrowed in thought.

Delia: Who could have written this? And why?

Suddenly, her cat, Sherlock, jumps up onto the table and starts to sniff at the paper.

Delia: What do you think, Sherlock?

Sherlock starts to meow and Delia takes that as a sign that he wants to help her solve the mystery.

CUT TO:

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

Delia is back at the library, looking through the book that she found on her desk. She's flipping through the pages, trying to find a clue, when she hears someone coming. She quickly shuts the book and puts it back on the desk, just as Mrs. Johnson walks in.

Mrs. Johnson: Delia, what are you doing in here?

Delia: Just looking at some books.

Mrs. Johnson: You're always looking at books.

Delia: I know. I can't help it.

Mrs. Johnson: Well, you should get back to work. We have a lot of people who want to check out books today.

Delia: Okay, Mrs. Johnson.

Delia goes back to her office and starts to look through the book again. She's about to give up when she finally finds what she's looking for. There's a bookmark tucked into the pages and, written on it, is the name of the victim.

Delia: Bingo.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Delia walks into the police station and approaches the desk sergeant.

Delia: Hi. I'd like to talk to someone about a murder.

Desk Sergeant: Do you have any information about the murder of James Saunders?

Delia: Yes, I do.

Desk Sergeant: Come with me.

The desk sergeant leads Delia into a room where two detectives are waiting.

Detective 1: What do you know about the murder of James Saunders?

Delia: I know who did it.

Detective 2: Who?

Delia: Mayor Johnson.
