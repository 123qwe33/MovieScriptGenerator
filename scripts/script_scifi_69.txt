FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

A storm rages through the cosmos, crackling with electricity. The camera pans across the storm to reveal the moon in its path.

The storm hits the moon, shattering it into pieces. The debris flies towards the Earth.

EXT. EARTH - NIGHT

The debris from the moon collides with the Earth, plunging the planet into darkness.

The camera pans across the globe, showing the effects of the darkness. Cities are plunged into darkness, and panic is spreading.

In the countryside, animals are going crazy, running in all directions.

Suddenly, the power goes out all over the world.

INT. SCIENTIFIC LAB - NIGHT

A team of scientists is frantically working on a solution to the problem.

SCIENTIST 1

We need to find a new source of energy, fast!

SCIENTIST 2

The sun is our only hope.

SCIENTIST 1

But how are we going to get there?

SCIENTIST 2

I've been working on a spaceship that can take us there.

SCIENTIST 1

Can it fly in the storm?

SCIENTIST 2

It's our only chance.

The scientists finish their preparations and board the spaceship.

INT. SPACESHIP - NIGHT

The scientists strap themselves into their seats.

SCIENTIST 1

Here goes nothing.

The spaceship takes off into the storm.

EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

The spaceship is buffeted by the storm as it makes its way towards the sun.

Suddenly, the sun disappears.

SCIENTIST 2

What happened to it?

SCIENTIST 1

I don't know. But we need to find it before it's too late.
