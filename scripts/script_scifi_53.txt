FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The vast emptiness of space stretches out in all directions. A small dot moves through the void, growing larger as it nears.

As the dot gets closer, it is revealed to be a spaceship. The ship is sleek and advanced, with strange markings on its hull.

The ship enters Earth's atmosphere and begins to descend.

EXT. CITY - DAY

The ship comes to a stop in the middle of a busy city. People on the street stop and stare at the strange vessel.

Suddenly, the ship's hatch opens and a group of aliens step out. The aliens are humanoid, but their skin is a strange green color.

The aliens begin to walk through the city, seemingly oblivious to the people around them.

Suddenly, the aliens start to attack the people. They shoot beams of energy from their eyes, killing anyone they look at.

The people of the city panic and flee in all directions.

EXT. SCIENTIFIC LAB - DAY

A team of scientists is gathered around a table, looking at a computer screen.

On the screen is a map of the city, with red dots representing the aliens.

The scientists are frantically trying to find a way to stop the aliens. But as the dots on the map begin to multiply, they realize that they may not be able to save the human race after all.
