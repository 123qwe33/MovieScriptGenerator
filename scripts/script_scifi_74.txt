INT. LABORATORY - DAY The door bursts open and MILITARY OFFICERS swarm the room, guns drawn. The SCIENTISTS are startled and back away. MILITARY OFFICER We have orders to take you into custody. SCIENTIST 1 What? Why? MILITARY OFFICER The president wants you to stop your work. SCIENTIST 2 We're so close to finding a way to stop the apocalypse! MILITARY OFFICER I'm sorry, but we have our orders. The scientists are escorted out of the room at gunpoint. SCIENTIST 3 (to the other scientists) Quick, send a warning to the rest of the world! As the scientists are being led away, they set off a bomb that destroys the facility. A deadly virus is released into the air. SCIENTIST 4 No! The virus quickly spreads around the world, killing billions of people. Within a year, the virus has mutate and become even more deadly. The few survivors are left to try to rebuild the world in the midst of the devastation.
