FADE IN:

EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

Liz is walking up to the library, carrying a stack of books. She's humming to herself and looks happy.

LIZ

(to herself)

Just another day at the library. I love my job.

She walks through the front doors and into the main lobby.

LIZ

(to the woman at the front desk)

Good morning, Mrs. Saunders.

MRS. SAUNDERS

Good morning, Liz. You're in early today.

LIZ

Yes, I wanted to get a head start on my day.

Liz heads to the stacks. She's walking down the aisle, looking at the books.

LIZ

(to herself)

Let's see, where should I start today?

She stops and looks at a book.

LIZ

(to herself)

Hmm, this looks interesting.

She reaches for the book, but her hand stops in mid-air. She looks down and sees a hand sticking out from behind the books.

LIZ

(to herself)

What the...?

She slowly backs away from the body and runs to the front desk.

LIZ

(to Mrs. Saunders)

There's a body in the stacks!
