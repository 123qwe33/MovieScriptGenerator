FADE IN:

EXT. JAPANESE TOWN - DAY

A small town in Japan. It's a beautiful day, with blue skies and white clouds. But there's a feeling of unease in the air.

We see a group of people gathered around something on the ground. They're talking in hushed tones, and there's a look of shock on their faces.

We push through the crowd to see what they're looking at.

Lying on the ground is a young woman. She's very still, and there's a large black feather sticking out of her back.

Someone in the crowd starts to cry.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

The police station is a small, nondescript building. There's a police car parked out front, and a few officers milling around.

Inside, we see a group of detectives gathered around a desk. They're looking at a file, and there's a look of frustration on their faces.

One of the detectives, a woman in her early thirties, looks up as a man enters the room. He's carrying a camera.

DETECTIVE

Ah, you must be the journalist.

JOURNALIST

Yes, I'm here to ask about the murder.

DETECTIVE

I'm afraid we can't tell you anything. This is an ongoing investigation.

JOURNALIST

But surely you must have some leads?

DETECTIVE

We have nothing. The only clue we have is this black feather.

She holds up a evidence bag, containing the feather.

JOURNALIST

That's it?

DETECTIVE

I'm afraid so. We've interviewed everyone in the town, but no one saw anything.

JOURNALIST

What about the victim's family?

DETECTIVE

They're not talking to us.

JOURNALIST

Do you have any suspects?

DETECTIVE

No. Whoever did this is very clever. They covered their tracks well.

JOURNALIST

But you must have some idea of who did it?

DETECTIVE

(frustrated)

No. We have nothing.

JOURNALIST

What about the black feather? What does it mean?

DETECTIVE

We don't know. It's possible that it's some kind of ritualistic murder, but we can't be sure.

JOURNALIST

This is a small town. Surely someone must have seen something.

DETECTIVE

(sighs)

Look, I can't tell you any more. We're doing everything we can to solve this case.

JOURNALIST

Thank you for your time.

DETECTIVE

Yeah.

The journalist leaves the police station, deep in thought.

FADE TO BLACK.
