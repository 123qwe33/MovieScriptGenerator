FADE IN:

EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Jennie (22) is working as a waitress at a busy restaurant. She's wearing a uniform and a name tag. She looks tired and unhappy.

Suddenly, the door opens and a handsome stranger walks in. He's clearly not from around here. He's wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase. He looks around the restaurant and then his eyes lock on Jennie.

He walks over to her and they start talking. Jennie is clearly drawn to him. He's charming and sweet and she can't help but smile.

Suddenly, the restaurant gets busy and Jennie has to go to work. She gives him her number and he leaves.

Jennie is giddy with excitement. She's found someone who makes her feel alive.

EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Jennie is rushing into the hospital. She's wearing jeans and a t-shirt. Her hair is pulled back in a ponytail.

She gets to the front desk and asks for Alex. The nurse tells her that he's in room 304.

Jennie rushes to his room and finds him lying in the hospital bed. He's hooked up to a bunch of machines and he looks pale.

But he's alive and that's all that matters.

Jennie sits down next to him and takes his hand. She's finally able to be with him again.
