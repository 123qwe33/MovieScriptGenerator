FADE IN:

EXT. PARIS STREET - DAY

Antoinette Gautier walks down the busy street, her parasol shielding her from the harsh sun. She stops to admire a painting in a shop window, lost in the beauty of the scene.

Suddenly, she hears a gruff voice behind her.

CLAUDE MONET
What are you doing, standing there in the middle of the street? You'll get yourself killed.

Antoinette turns to see a tall, dark-haired man standing next to her. She's never seen him before, but there's something about him that intrigues her.

ANTOINETTE
I was just admiring the painting. It's so beautiful.

Claude looks at the painting, then back at Antoinette.

CLAUDE
Yes, it is.

He looks at her for a moment, then extends his hand.

CLAUDE (cont'd)
My name is Claude Monet.

Antoinette takes his hand and shakes it.

ANTOINETTE
I'm Antoinette Gautier.

Claude looks at her intently, as if trying to see into her soul. Antoinette feels a sudden connection to this stranger.

CLAUDE
Would you like to get some coffee?

ANTOINETTE
I would love to.

They walk down the street together, lost in conversation. Antoinette can't help but be drawn to Claude's dark aura.

FADE TO BLACK.
