FADE IN:

EXT. MONTMARTRE STEPS - DAY

CLAUDETTE (late 20s) and PIERRE (late 20s) meet by chance on the steps of the Montmartre. They instantly fall in love and begin a whirlwind romance, spending every waking moment together and declaring their undying love for one another.

CLAUDETTE: I love you, Pierre. I've never been so sure of anything in my life.

PIERRE: I love you too, Claudette. I'm going to love you forever.

However, just as things seem to be going perfectly, Claudette's estranged father appears and throws a wrench in the young couple's plans. He forbids them from seeing each other and makes Claudette move back to his home in the countryside. Pierre is heartbroken, but he knows he must respect Claudette's father's wishes. He promises to wait for her and never give up on their love.

CLAUDETTE: I don't want to leave you, Pierre. I'm going to miss you so much.

PIERRE: I'm going to miss you too, Claudette. But I promise, I'll wait for you. I'll never give up on us.

Claudette is miserable living away from Pierre, but she knows she must honor her father's wishes. However, she can't help but wonder if their love will be strong enough to overcome the obstacles thrown in their path.

CLAUDETTE: (voice-over) Will our love be strong enough to overcome this obstacle? I don't know. But I'm going to find out.
