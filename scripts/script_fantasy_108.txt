FADE IN:

EXT. HENRIK'S VILLAGE - DAY

The village is bustling with activity as people go about their daily lives. Henrik (19) is among them, working at the blacksmith's shop. He hammering away at a piece of metal when he's interrupted by a commotion from outside.

HENRIK

What's going on?

He sets down his hammer and goes to investigate. He pushes his way through the crowd to see what's happening.

HENRIK

What is it? What's going on?

Someone in the crowd points to the sky. Henrik looks up and gasps.

HENRIK

Dragons!

A group of dragons is flying overhead, headed straight for the village.

HENRIK

(to the crowd)

Everyone, get inside! Quickly!

The crowd starts to panic and rush towards the safety of the buildings. Henrik runs back to the blacksmith's shop.

HENRIK

(to the blacksmith)

Get everyone inside! The dragons are coming!

BLACKSMITH

(nods)

Go! I'll take care of everyone here.

Henrik nods and takes off running towards his home.

EXT. HENRIK'S HOUSE - DAY

Henrik bursts through the door of his house.

HENRIK

(to his wife, Elise)

Elise, the dragons are coming! We have to hide!

Elise (18) is Henrik's pregnant wife. She's in the middle of cooking dinner, but she quickly abandons her work to follow Henrik.

ELISE

(frightened)

What are we going to do?

HENRIK

(looks around the room, thinking)

The cellar. We'll go to the cellar.

He takes her hand and leads her to the door to the cellar. He opens it and they start to descend the stairs.

HENRIK

(to Elise)

It's going to be alright. I promise.

ELISE

(nods, tears in her eyes)

I trust you.

They reach the bottom of the stairs and Henrik closes the door, plunging them into darkness. They sit in silence, waiting for the dragons to pass.

Suddenly, they hear a loud crash from upstairs. Henrik jumps to his feet.

HENRIK

(to Elise)

Stay here. I'm going to see what's happening.

ELISE

(frightened)

Be careful.

HENRIK

(nods)

I will.

He climbs the stairs and opens the door a crack, peeking out. He gasps when he sees what's happening.

The dragons are attacking the village, burning everything in sight. People are running and screaming in all directions.

HENRIK

(to himself)

I have to help them.

He closes the door and goes back downstairs.

HENRIK

(to Elise)

I have to go.

ELISE

(crying)

No, Henrik, you can't! It's too dangerous!

HENRIK

(determined)

I have to. I can't just sit here and do nothing.

He gives her a quick kiss, then heads back upstairs.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Henrik runs through the streets, dodging dragons and flames. He's headed for the center of the village, where the blacksmith's shop is located.

As he nears the shop, he sees a group of demons chasing a group of villagers. The villagers are screaming and trying to get away, but the demons are closing in on them.

Henrik knows he has to do something. He concentrates and feels his body start to change. He grows taller and his limbs transform into those of a dragon. He opens his mouth and a jet of fire erupts, incinerating the demons.

The villagers stare at him in shock, then they start to cheer.

HENRIK

(in a deep, dragon voice)

Do not fear. I will protect you.
