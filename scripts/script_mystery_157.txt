FADE IN:

EXT. MRS. WORTHY'S HOUSE - DAY

Detective Sergeant Mike Nash is walking up to the house of Mrs. Worthy, an elderly woman who has been receiving threatening letters. He is met at the door by Jane, Mrs. Worthy's daughter.

JANE

Detective Nash. Thank you for coming.

DETECTIVE NASH

What can I do for you, Mrs. Worthy?

JANE

It's my mother. She's dead.

Nash is shocked by the news.

DETECTIVE NASH

What happened?

JANE

I think she was killed because of the letters she was receiving.

Nash takes out his notebook and starts to take down some notes.

DETECTIVE NASH

Tell me about the letters.

JANE

They started coming about a month ago. They were all anonymous, but they were all threatening my mother in some way.

DETECTIVE NASH

Did your mother have any enemies that you know of?

JANE

No, she was a lovely woman. Everyone in the neighborhood liked her.

NASH

What about the people who received the letters? Do they have anything in common?

JANE

Not that I know of.

NASH

I'll need to speak to them. Do you have a list of names?

JANE

Yes, I'll get it for you.

Jane goes into the house and comes back a few moments later with a piece of paper. Nash takes it from her and looks at the names.

DETECTIVE NASH

I'll take care of this. You have my condolences.

JANE

Thank you.

Nash starts to walk away, but Jane stops him.

JANE

Detective?

NASH

Yes?

JANE

My mother wasn't the only one keeping a secret. Everyone on that list has something they're hiding from someone.

NASH

What are you saying?

JANE

I think the killer is using people's secrets against them.

NASH

Thank you for the information. I'll take it from here.

Nash starts to walk away again, but Jane stops him once more.

JANE

Detective?

NASH

Yes?

JANE

Be careful. This killer is very clever.

NASH

I'll do my best.

FADE OUT.
