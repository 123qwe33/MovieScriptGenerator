FADE IN:

EXT. FOREST - DAY

A young woman, LIANA, is walking through the forest, looking lost and confused. She stops and looks around, as if trying to get her bearings.

Suddenly, she hears a noise in the distance. She starts to walk towards it, when she is suddenly attacked by a group of bandits. She fights them off, but is outnumbered and outnumbered.

Just as the bandits are about to overpower her, she is saved by a group of soldiers. They take her back to their camp, where she is introduced to their leader, PRINCE KAI.

Kai tells her that she is the reincarnated princess of a lost kingdom. He says that she must venture into a strange and dangerous land to find her rightful place on the throne.

Liana is skeptical, but Kai is adamant. He says that she must trust him and follow him if she wants to find her true identity.

Liana agrees, and the two of them set off into the dangerous land. Along the way, they discover her true love, and must make a difficult choice between duty and love.
