FADE IN:

EXT. FOREST - DAY

A group of soldiers, clad in armor and armed with swords, move through the woods silently. They are led by a woman, also in armor, who holds a sword in one hand and a shield in the other. She is alert, her eyes scanning the trees for any sign of danger.

Suddenly, an arrow whizzes by her head, and she ducks instinctively. The soldiers behind her do the same.

WOMAN

(quietly, to the soldiers)

Archers, take cover!

The soldiers quickly disperse, seeking shelter behind trees and boulders. The woman crouches behind a fallen tree trunk.

Suddenly, a hail of arrows comes raining down on them, and the woman pops up to return fire. She nocks an arrow and lets it fly, taking down one of the enemy archers.

WOMAN

(to the soldiers)

Advance!

The soldiers rush forward, swords drawn. The woman leads the charge, her sword swinging. She cuts down anyone who gets in her way, her shield deflecting enemy blows.

The battle is fierce, but eventually the woman and her soldiers emerge victorious. The woman stands over the bodies of the fallen, her chest heaving with breath and her sword dripping with blood.

WOMAN

(to the soldiers)

This is only the beginning. We will take back what is rightfully ours!
