INT. TAMARA’S OFFICE - DAY

TAMARA is sitting at her desk, working on her laptop. She’s dressed in a professional suit and looks like she’s in her early thirties.

TAMARA

(typing on her laptop)

Yes, I’ll be able to make that meeting. Thank you.

She hits send on her email and then leans back in her chair, stretching her arms above her head.

TAMARA

(sighing)

Another day, another dollar.

She gets up from her desk and walks over to the window. She looks out at the cityscape and sighs.

TAMARA

(to herself)

Is this really all there is?

She stares out the window for a moment, lost in thought. Then she shakes her head and turns away.

TAMARA

(to herself)

No, I’m not going to think like that. I’m successful, I’m beautiful, I’m lucky.

She goes back to her desk and sits down. She looks at her laptop and then opens up a dating website. She starts to fill out her profile.

TAMARA

(to herself)

Maybe this is the year I finally find Mr. Right.

INT. A RESTAURANT - NIGHT

TAMARA is sitting at a table, waiting for her date. She’s dressed in a nice dress and looks nervous. She checks her watch and then looks around the restaurant.

TAMARA

(to herself)

Where is he? He’s already ten minutes late.

Just then, ANDREW walks into the restaurant. He sees TAMARA and starts to walk over to her.

ANDREW

(smiling)

I’m so sorry I’m late.

TAMARA

(stands up, smiling)

It’s okay, I understand.

ANDREW

(pulls out her chair)

Please, sit down.

TAMARA

(sits down)

Thank you.

ANDREW

(sits down across from her)

So, what would you like to drink?

TAMARA

(smiling)

I’ll have a glass of wine.

ANDREW

(signals the waiter)

I’ll have the same.

The waiter comes over and takes their drink order.

WAITER

(to TAMARA)

And what would you like for dinner?

TAMARA

(to the waiter)

I’ll have the salmon, please.

The waiter nods and then turns to ANDREW.

WAITER

(to ANDREW)

And for you, sir?

ANDREW

(to the waiter)

I’ll have the steak.

The waiter nods and then walks away.

ANDREW

(to TAMARA)

So, tell me about yourself.

TAMARA

(smiling)

Well, where should I start?
