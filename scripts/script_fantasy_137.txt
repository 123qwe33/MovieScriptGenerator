FADE IN:

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Lysanthir Zym√≥s is playing with his friends near a small stream that flows through the forest.

LYSANTHIR

(to his friends)

Come on, let's explore that cave over there!

Lysanthir's friends hesitate, but Lysanthir is already running towards the cave.

FRIEND 1

(to FRIEND 2)

I don't know, it looks kind of dark in there.

FRIEND 2

(to FRIEND 1)

Yeah, I don't want to get lost.

FRIEND 1

(to FRIEND 2)

Lysanthir is going to go in there whether we want to or not.

FRIEND 2

(to FRIEND 1)

Fine, but you're staying close to me.

Lysanthir enters the cave, with his friends following close behind.

FRIEND 1

(to FRIEND 2)

Do you see anything?

FRIEND 2

(to FRIEND 1)

No, it's too dark in here.

Lysanthir's friends are getting scared and are about to turn back when Lysanthir stumbles upon something.

LYSANTHIR

(to his friends)

Guys, I found something!

FRIEND 1

(to FRIEND 2)

What is it?

FRIEND 2

(to FRIEND 1)

I don't know, let's go see.

Lysanthir's friends come over and they all see that it is a creature that is wounded and dying.

LYSANTHIR

(to his friends)

We have to help it!

FRIEND 1

(to LYSANTHIR)

But what is it?

LYSANTHIR

(to FRIEND 1)

I don't know, but we can't just leave it here to die.

FRIEND 2

(to LYSANTHIR)

Lysanthir is right, we have to help it.

Lysanthir and his friends take the creature back to Lysanthir's house and nurse it back to health. Once it is better, they find out that it is a magical creature called a fae.

FAE

(to LYSANTHIR)

Thank you for saving me, Lysanthir. I am in your debt.

LYSANTHIR

(to the FAE)

You're welcome. But what are you?

FAE

(to LYSANTHIR)

I am a fae. We are magical creatures that live in this forest.

LYSANTHIR

(to the FAE)

Wow, I've never seen anything like you before.

FAE

(to LYSANTHIR)

As a token of my gratitude, I will grant you three wishes.

LYSANTHIR

(to the FAE)

Really? Anything I want?

FAE

(to LYSANTHIR)

Anything you want.

Lysanthir thinks for a moment.

LYSANTHIR

(to the FAE)

I wish that my village would be safe from the evil that is coming for it.

FAE

(to LYSANTHIR)

Your wish is my command.

The fae waves its hand and a shimmering barrier appears around the village.

LYSANTHIR

(to the FAE)

Thank you!

FAE

(to LYSANTHIR)

You are welcome, Lysanthir. What is your second wish?
