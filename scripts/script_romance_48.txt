FADE IN:

EXT. JENNA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

JENNA (late 20s) is walking up to her house after a long day at work. She's carrying a bag of groceries and her dog, RUFUS (a small terrier), is following behind her. Jenna is tired, but she's looking forward to her weekend.

JENNA

(to Rufus)

Come on, boy. Let's get inside.

Suddenly, JENNA hears a noise behind her. She turns around and sees a handsome stranger (CALEB, early 30s) standing there.

CALEB

Hello, Jenna.

JENNA

(surprised)

Who are you?

Caleb takes a step closer to Jenna.

CALEB

My name is Caleb. I'm here to help you.

JENNA

(confused)

Help me? What are you talking about?

Caleb looks around, as if he's making sure no one is watching them.

CALEB

You're in danger, Jenna. I've been sent to protect you.

JENNA

(laughing)

What? That's ridiculous. I'm not in danger.

Caleb is serious.

CALEB

You have a rare ability, Jenna. There are people who will stop at nothing to get their hands on it.

JENNA

(skeptical)

What ability?

Caleb doesn't answer. He just looks at Jenna, as if he's trying to gauge her reaction.

JENNA

(to Caleb)

Look, I don't know what you're talking about. But I'm not interested. So please, just leave me alone.

Caleb doesn't move.

CALEB

I can't do that, Jenna. I'm here to protect you.

JENNA

(exasperated)

From what?

Caleb doesn't answer. He just looks at Jenna, his expression serious.

JENNA

(sighing)

Fine. Come inside. But I'm warning you, if you're just some crazy person, I'm calling the police.

Caleb nods.

CALEB

I understand.

JENNA unlocks her door and they both go inside.
