INT. LILY'S HOUSE - DAY Lily is sitting at her kitchen table, looking at a photo of her and her husband. She's lost in thought when there's a knock at the door. She gets up to answer it. LILY

(smiling)

Hey, John. JOHN

(smiling back)

Hey, Lily. I brought you some flowers. He hands her a bouquet of flowers and she invites him in. LILY

(smelling the flowers)

Thank you, they're beautiful. JOHN

(looking around)

Nice place you have here. LILY

(nodding)

It's been my home for a long time. JOHN

(sitting down)

So, how are you today? LILY

(sighing)

I'm all right, I guess. Just missing him today. JOHN

(reaches over and takes her hand)

I know. I miss him too. They sit there for a moment, lost in their own thoughts. Finally, Lily speaks up. LILY

(clearing her throat)

So, what did you do today? JOHN

(shifting in his seat)

Oh, not much. Just went to work and then came over here. LILY

(nodding)

I see. Well, I'm glad you're here. JOHN

(smiling)

Me too, Lily. Me too.
