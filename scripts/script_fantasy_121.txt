FADE IN:

EXT. PIRO'S FARM - DAWN

PIRO, a young farm boy, is up early, milking the cows. He is tired and his hands are sore from all the work.

PIRO

(to himself)

Another day...

Suddenly, PIRO hears a loud noise. He looks up and sees a group of strange creatures, with wings, flying overhead. He has never seen anything like them before.

PIRO

(to himself)

What are those things?

PIRO watches as the creatures fly towards the nearby kingdom. He knows that his kingdom has been at war with that kingdom for as long as he can remember.

PIRO

(to himself)

The war...

PIRO knows that he should warn the others, but he is too afraid. He watches as the creatures disappear into the distance.

PIRO

(to himself)

I have to tell someone...

Suddenly, PIRO hears shouting. He looks up and sees the creatures attacking the kingdom. He knows that he has to do something.

PIRO

(to himself)

I have to help...

PIRO uses his magic to stop the creatures. He has never done anything like this before.

PIRO

(to himself)

What am I doing?

PIRO knows that he has to find the others and stop the creatures. He starts to run towards the kingdom.

FADE OUT.
