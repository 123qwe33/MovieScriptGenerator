FADE IN:

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Lysanthir Zumra is tracking a group of orcs through the forest. He has been following them for days and knows that they are up to no good. He comes to a clearing and sees the orcs in the distance. They are pillaging a village and setting fire to the houses. Lysanthir knows that he cannot take them on alone and must find help.

He continues to follow the orcs and eventually comes across a group of dwarves who are also tracking them. He explains the situation to them and they agree to help him. Together, they set off after the orcs.

After days of hard travel, they finally catch up to the orcs. They launch a surprise attack and are able to defeat them. Lysanthir and the dwarves return to the nearest town to warn them of the danger and to help them rebuild.

FADE OUT.
