FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

Akiko walks down the street, her eyes darting around as she looks for her next mark. She's a private investigator, and she's not afraid to get her hands dirty. She's been hired by a woman named Ayumi to find her missing husband, and she's quickly pulled into a web of lies and deceit. She quickly realizes that everyone she talks to is hiding something, and she has to use all her wits to figure out who is telling the truth and who is lying. The case leads her to the seedy underworld of the city, and she quickly finds herself in over her head. She's not afraid to play dirty to get the answers she needs, and she's not afraid to put her own life on the line to solve the case.

Akiko spots her mark and follows him down an alleyway. She's not afraid to get her hands dirty, and she's not afraid to put her own life on the line to solve the case.

Suddenly, the man she's following stops and turns around. He knows he's being followed, and he's not happy about it.

MAN

Hey! Who the hell are you?

Akiko doesn't hesitate. She pulls out her gun and points it at the man.

AKIKO

I'm the person who's going to find out what you're hiding.

The man knows he's in over his head, and he quickly surrenders. Akiko has him pinned against the wall, and she's not going to let him go until she gets the answers she needs.

AKIKO

Now, let's start with your name.
