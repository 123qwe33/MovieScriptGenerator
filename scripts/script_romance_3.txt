FADE IN:

EXT. I-80 WEST - DAY

HANNAH (19) and her best friend ABIGAIL (19) are driving cross-country in Hannah's beat-up station wagon. They're both excited and nervous for the adventure ahead.

ABIGAIL

Are you sure you're ready for this?

HANNAH

Of course I am. I need to get out of town.

ABIGAIL

I know, me too. But it's a big world out there.

HANNAH

We can handle it. Together.

ABIGAIL

Together.

They smile at each other and keep driving.

Suddenly, a handsome young man in a beat-up truck pulls up alongside them. He smiles and waves. Hannah and Abigail can't help but stare.

IAN (20)

Need a hand?

HANNAH

What?

IAN

Your engine sounds like it's about to give out.

HANNAH

Oh, um, no, we're fine. Thanks.

IAN

You sure? I know a thing or two about cars.

ABIGAIL

We're sure, thank you.

Hannah gives Abigail a look. She can't believe she just turned down help from a cute guy.

IAN

Suit yourself. But if you break down, don't say I didn't offer to help.

He smiles and drives off. Hannah and Abigail can't help but watch him go.

HANNAH

Wow.

ABIGAIL

I know, right?

HANNAH

He was cute.

ABIGAIL

And helpful.

HANNAH

Yeah, I guess so.

They both laugh and keep driving.
