FADE IN:

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Makoto, a private detective, is walking down a dark street, looking for a lead in a case. He's a little scruffy, and has a troubled look in his eye. He's been through a lot in his life, and it has taken its toll on him.

Suddenly, he hears a noise coming from an alleyway. He draws his gun and cautiously approaches.

As he enters the alley, he is attacked by a man with a knife. He manages to fight him off, but not before getting a deep cut on his arm.

Makoto stumbles out of the alley and into the street, where he is met by a woman.

WOMAN

Makoto, what happened?

MAKOTO

I'm fine, just a little cut.

WOMAN

You're bleeding! Come with me, I'll help you.

Makoto is hesitant, but the woman is insistent. He finally relents and goes with her.

FADE TO BLACK.
