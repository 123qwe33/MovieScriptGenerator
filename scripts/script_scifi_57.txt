FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - DAY

A vast expanse of stars and planets.

Suddenly, a small object comes into view. It's a spaceship.

CUT TO:

INT. SPACESHIP - DAY

The ship is small and cramped. There are several people inside, all wearing spacesuits.

One of the people, a woman, is looking out the window. She's transfixed by the sight of the stars.

Suddenly, her attention is drawn to something else. There's a planet in front of them. It's covered in a strange energy field.

The woman looks at the other people in the ship. They all seem to be as transfixed as she is.

CUT TO:

EXT. PLANET - DAY

The spaceship lands on the planet. There's a team of people who exit the ship.

They're all wearing protective gear. They start to explore the planet.

They soon find the source of the energy field. It's a creature, unlike anything they've ever seen before.

The creature is hostile and attacks the humans. They fight back and eventually defeats it, but at a great cost.

Many humans are killed and the creature is destroyed. However, the experience has changed the humans. They now know that there are other intelligent life forms out there and that they're not alone.

FADE TO BLACK.
