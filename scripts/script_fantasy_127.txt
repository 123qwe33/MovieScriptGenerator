INT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT

A figure moves through the darkness, silent and stealthy. We can't see his face, but we can see the glint of a knife in his hand. He's hunting.

The figure stops at the entrance to an alley. He can hear the sound of footsteps, soft and hesitant. Someone is coming. The figure readies his weapon and waits.

The footsteps get closer and closer until a woman appears in the entrance to the alley. She's young and pretty, but she looks terrified. The figure springs from the shadows and grabs her. She screams.

FIGURE:

Shh, it's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.

WOMAN:

Please, let me go!

FIGURE:

I can't do that. You're in danger.

The woman struggles to free herself, but the figure holds her tight.

FIGURE:

I promise, I'll keep you safe.
