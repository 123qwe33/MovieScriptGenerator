FADE IN:

EXT. SOUTH OF FRANCE - DAY

The sun is shining and the sky is blue. We see a beautiful landscape of rolling hills and vineyards.

We see a young woman, MARIE, walking along a path. She is smiling and seems to be enjoying the day.

Suddenly, she sees a man, PIERRE, walking towards her. They smile at each other and start talking.

We can tell that there is a strong connection between them. They continue talking and walking together.

 eventually reach a small village. We see a large, imposing house.

MARIE:

This is where you live?

PIERRE:

Yes, my family is very wealthy.

MARIE:

It's so beautiful.

PIERRE:

Would you like to come inside?

MARIE:

Yes, I would love to.

They walk into the house and we can see that Pierre's parents are not happy to see Marie.

PIERRE'S MOTHER:

Who is this?

PIERRE:

This is Marie. We just met.

PIERRE'S MOTHER:

You cannot bring her into this house.

PIERRE:

Why not?

PIERRE'S MOTHER:

Because she is not good enough for us.

Marie looks hurt and she starts to leave.

PIERRE:

Wait, Marie.

He runs after her and they walk away from the house together.

PIERRE:

I'm sorry about my parents. They're just very traditional and they don't approve of our relationship.

MARIE:

It's okay. I understand.

They continue walking and we can see the love between them.
