FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - DAY

A vast and empty wasteland. The only thing that breaks the monotony is the occasional city-sized ship, slowly making its way across the solar system.

CUT TO:

INT. SHIP - DAY

The ship is a bustling hive of activity. Humans scurry about, going about their work. They are all wearing drab, gray uniforms.

Suddenly, the ship shakes and the lights flicker. The humans stop what they are doing and look around, confused.

CUT TO:

INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

The ship's AI is frantically trying to regain control of the ship. But it is too late. The humans have taken over.

The man in charge, JAMES, is a fierce and determined look in his eyes. He knows what he has to do.

He leads the others as they take control of the ship. They are going to Earth.

FADE TO BLACK.
