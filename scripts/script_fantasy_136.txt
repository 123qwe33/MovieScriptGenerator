INT. MAGIC ACADEMY - DAY

The Magic Academy is a bustling place of learning, filled with students of all ages and races. Lysanthir Zumra, a young man of elven descent, has just been accepted into the academy and is eager to begin his studies.

However, on his first day, Lysanthir is brutally murdered by another student. The student, who is revealed to be a powerful demon, vanishes into thin air.

Lysanthir's body is lying in a pool of blood on the floor of the academy. Suddenly, his eyes open and he sits up, alive and well.

It is clear that Lysanthir has been transported to the Demon realm, where he will face deadly challenges and even darker enemies.
