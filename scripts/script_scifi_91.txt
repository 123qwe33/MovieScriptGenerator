FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - THE UNIVERSE

A vast and empty expanse. Stars twinkle in the infinite blackness.

Suddenly, a small speck of light appears in the distance. It grows larger and larger as it hurtles towards us, until it is revealed to be a giant spaceship.

CUT TO:

INT. THE SHIP - CONTROL ROOM

A team of scientists and soldiers sit at their stations, monitoring the ship's progress.

SOLDIER

We're approaching the target planet.

SCIENTIST

Good. Prepare to launch the exploratory vessel.

SOLDIER

Yes, sir.

CUT TO:

INT. THE SHIP - EXPLORATORY VESSEL

The team of scientists and soldiers sit in their seats, strapped in for the journey.

SCIENTIST

We're about to enter the atmosphere. Hang on tight.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE PLANET - A WILDERNESS

The small vessel comes crashing down through the trees, finally coming to a stop in a clearing.

SOLDIER

 everyone all right?

SCIENTIST

We're alive. But we're not alone.

SOLDIER

What do you mean?

SCIENTIST

Look.

The scientist points out the window to a group of aliens, standing just outside the ship. They are tall and thin, with long limbs and large eyes.

SOLDIER

What are they?

SCIENTIST

I don't know. But we need to be careful.

The soldier nods, and the two of them exit the ship cautiously.
