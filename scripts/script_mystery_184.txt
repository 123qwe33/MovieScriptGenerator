FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

A body lies in a pool of blood, charred beyond recognition. A single black button is sewn into the lining of the coat.

DETECTIVE AYAKA KURENAI (30s) kneels down next to the body, her face grim. She takes out her notebook and starts to jot down some notes.

KURENAI

Another one.

She looks up as a police officer approaches.

POLICE OFFICER

What do we have here?

KURENAI

Another victim. Arson, most likely.

The police officer nods and goes to call for backup. Kurenai looks back down at the body, her mind racing.

KURENAI

Who are you? And what did you get yourself mixed up in?

She stands up and starts to walk away, her mind already working on the case.

FADE TO BLACK.
