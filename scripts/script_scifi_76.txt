FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - DAY

A small space trader ship, the Star Runner, cruises through the vast emptiness of space.

INT. STAR RUNNER - COCKPIT

Jeff, the portly captain of the Star Runner, sits in the pilot's seat, while his First Mate, Sarah, sits in the co-pilot's seat.

JEFF

I still can't believe we got the gig.

SARAH

I know. It's a lot of money.

JEFF

Yeah, but it's a lot of risk.

SARAH

What do you mean?

JEFF

I mean, we're carrying a lot of valuable cargo. If we get attacked, we're sitting ducks.

SARAH

Don't worry, Jeff. We'll be fine.

JEFF

I hope you're right.

Suddenly, the ship is rocked by a massive explosion.

JEFF

What the hell was that?

SARAH

We're under attack!
