FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

A busy city street at night. Cars and people pass by in a blur.

Suddenly, a man comes running down the street, frantically looking around. He's disheveled and out of breath.

He stops at a payphone and frantically dials a number.

MAN

(into phone)

Hello? I need help! My wife is missing!

He listens for a moment, then hangs up in frustration.

He looks around again, then starts running down the street.

CUT TO:

INT. DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A small, cramped office. A single lightbulb hangs overhead, casting a harsh light.

A man sits at a desk, smoking a cigarette. He's a detective, and he looks tired and world-weary.

The door opens and the frantic man from before comes rushing in.

MAN

(out of breath)

Please, you have to help me! My wife is missing!

DETECTIVE

(sighs)

All right, calm down. Let's start from the beginning.

CUT TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

The detective and the man are walking down the street. The man is talking rapidly, gesturing wildly.

MAN

...and then she just vanished! I've looked everywhere, but I can't find her!

DETECTIVE

(skeptical)

Have you checked with her friends? Family?

MAN

(nods)

Yes, of course. But no one has seen her. I'm at my wit's end!

DETECTIVE

(nods)

All right. Let's take a look at her last known whereabouts.

CUT TO:

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

The detective and the man are in the man's apartment. It's a small, cramped space.

The man points to a photo on the wall.

MAN

This is her. My wife, Emily.

DETECTIVE

(examines photo)

When was the last time you saw her?

MAN

(sighs)

Two days ago. We had a fight... I said some things I shouldn't have. And then she just left.

DETECTIVE

(nods)

All right. I'll need a list of her friends and family.

CUT TO:

INT. DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The detective is sitting at his desk, smoking a cigarette. He's going through a file of papers.

Suddenly, the door opens and his assistant comes rushing in.

ASSISTANT

(out of breath)

I think I found something!

DETECTIVE

(skeptical)

What is it?

ASSISTANT

(pulls out a sheet of paper)

I was going through the missing person's report and I found this.

DETECTIVE

(takes paper)

What is it?

ASSISTANT

(points to paper)

It's an address. I think it's where the missing person was last seen.

DETECTIVE

(nods)

All right. Let's take a look.

CUT TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

The detective and the assistant are walking down the street. The assistant is talking rapidly.

ASSISTANT

...and that's when I found the address. I think it's where the missing person was last seen.

DETECTIVE

(skeptical)

Do you have any proof?

ASSISTANT

(nods)

I checked the address against the missing person's report. There was a witness who saw her near that address the day she disappeared.

DETECTIVE

(nods)

All right. Let's take a look.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The detective and the assistant are outside an abandoned warehouse. The assistant is shining a flashlight.

ASSISTANT

(points to door)

I think this is it.

DETECTIVE

(skeptical)

All right. Let's take a look.

The detective tries the door, but it
