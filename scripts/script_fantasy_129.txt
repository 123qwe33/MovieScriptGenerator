INT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

Mia (11) is running, terror in her eyes. She is being chased by a group of men with knives. She is exhausted and terrified, and she knows they are going to kill her.

Mia: (screaming) Help! Someone help me!

She trips and falls, and the men are upon her. She kicks and screams, but they overpower her. One of the men raises his knife to kill her, but Mia grabs a rock and hits him in the head with it. He falls to the ground, and Mia grabs his knife. She stabs another man in the stomach, and he falls to the ground, clutching his wound. The other men run away in terror. Mia is panting and shaking, her hands covered in blood. She looks down at the two men she has killed, and she feels nothing.

Mia: (voiceover) I killed my first two men when I was eleven years old. I didn't feel anything then, and I don't feel anything now. Killing is just a part of who I am.
