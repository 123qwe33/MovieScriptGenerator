FADE IN:

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Nala walks through the forest, her clothes tattered and her body covered in bruises. She's been walking for days, and she's exhausted. She stops to rest for a moment, leaning against a tree. She looks around, her eyes filled with despair.

NALA

(voiceover)

I don't know how much longer I can keep going. I thought I would find help in the next town, but...

She breaks down into tears, her body shaking with sobs.

NALA

(voiceover)

I can't do this anymore. I can't keep going.

Suddenly, she hears a voice in the distance.

STRANGER

Hello? Is someone there?

Nala's eyes widen in surprise. She quickly wipes away her tears and stands up.

NALA

Yes! I'm here!

She starts to run towards the voice.

STRANGER

Wait! I can't see you!

Nala stops and looks around, trying to find the stranger.

NALA

Where are you?

STRANGER

I'm over here!

Nala follows the voice until she comes to a clearing. In the center of the clearing is a small cabin.

NALA

This is your home?

STRANGER

Yes. Come inside, out of the cold.

Nala hesitates for a moment, but then she nods and walks towards the cabin.

FADE TO BLACK.
