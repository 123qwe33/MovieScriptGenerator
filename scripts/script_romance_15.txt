INT. BAR - NIGHT

Chloe walks into the bar and heads over to the counter.

BARTENDER

Hey, what can I get you?

Chloe

I'll have a cosmopolitan, please.

BARTENDER

Coming right up.

Chloe looks around the bar and sees her friends sitting at a table in the corner. She waves to them and starts to walk over.

Suddenly, she notices a handsome stranger sitting at the bar. She can't help but stare at him, and when their eyes meet, she feels a sudden spark of electricity.

Chloe walks over to the stranger and introduces herself.

CHLOE

Hi, I'm Chloe.

STRANGER

I'm Alex. Nice to meet you.

They start talking and realize that they have a lot in common. They end up closing the bar down, talking and laughing the whole night.

When it's time to go, Alex offers to walk Chloe home. She accepts, and they share a passionate kiss goodnight.

Chloe and Alex walk into Chloe's apartment.

CHLOE

I had a really great time tonight.

ALEX

Me too. I'll see you soon.

They share another kiss, and then Alex leaves.

Chloe can't wait to see the stranger again, and they start dating. They're both head over heels in love, and they seems to be perfect for each other.

But just as they're talking about taking their relationship to the next level, the stranger suddenly breaks things off, leaving Chloe heartbroken.

INT. CHLOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Chloe is on the phone, talking to her friends.

CHLOE

I don't want to go out tonight. I'm just not in the mood.

Suddenly, there's a knock at the door. Chloe hangs up the phone and goes to answer it.

It's the stranger.

STRANGER

Hi, Chloe. I hope you don't mind me dropping by.

CHLOE

No, it's fine. Come in.

They sit down and start talking. The stranger explains that he had been going through some personal issues that he wasn't ready to share, but he's finally in a good place now. He's realized that he still loves Chloe, and he wants to give their relationship another chance.

She agrees, and they pick up right where they left off. They eventually get married and live happily ever after.
