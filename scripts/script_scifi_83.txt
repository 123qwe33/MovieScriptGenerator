Suddenly, the door opens and a group of aliens come in. The humans stand up, looking scared.

ALIEN LEADER:

I am the leader of the invading force. You are the survivors of our attack on Earth.

HUMAN 1:

What do you want with us?

ALIEN LEADER:

You are to be our slaves. You will work for us, and you will obey our every command.

HUMAN 2:

What if we refuse?

ALIEN LEADER:

Then you will be killed.

The aliens begin to herd the humans out of the room.

Wait! What about our families?

They are all dead.

The ship lands on a strange, hostile planet. The humans are pushed out of the ship, and the aliens take off, leaving them stranded.

HUMAN 4:

What are we going to do now?

HUMAN 1:

We need to find a way off this planet.

HUMAN 2:

But how? There's no way we can build a ship.

HUMAN 3:

And even if we could, we don't know how to fly it.

HUMAN 4:

We need to find some help.

Suddenly, a group of aliens come out of the ship. They are all armed with weapons.

ALIEN LEADER:

You are to come with us. You will be our slaves.

HUMAN 1:

No! We won't go with you!

ALIEN LEADER:

You have no choice.

The aliens begin to herd the humans away.

What are they going to do to us?

I don't know. But whatever it is, it can't be good.

Suddenly, there is a loud noise. The aliens stop and look around, confused.

HUMAN 4:

What is that?

ALIEN LEADER:

I don't know. But whatever it is, it's coming this way.

The aliens start to panic. They begin to run, leaving the humans behind.

HUMAN 1:

What's going on?

HUMAN 2:

I don't know. But whatever it is, it can't be good.
