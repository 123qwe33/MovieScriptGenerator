FADE IN:

EXT. FROZEN TUNDRA - DAY

A vast, empty landscape. White as far as the eye can see.

Suddenly, a small figure appears on the horizon. It's a half-breed girl, barely more than a baby. She's crying and shivering, but she keeps moving forward.

The girl is Fiona. She's born in the worst place possible: on the edge of a frozen tundra. But she's determined to survive.

Fiona starts to learn how to survive in this hostile world. She values strength, speed, and resourcefulness above all else.

Fiona must start as the bottom of the pack and work to become the leader of her pack in order to protect them from others who would do them harm.
