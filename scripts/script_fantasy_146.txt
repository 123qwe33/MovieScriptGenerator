EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

A harsh, dark world. A young girl, ANNabelle, is orphaned and left to fend for herself. She is taken in by a group of bandits who teach her how to fight and survive.

Annabelle grows up to be a fierce warrior, and becomes the leader of the bandits. When a rival bandit group attacks, Annabelle leads her group to victory. But at a cost.

In the aftermath of the battle, Annabelle is the only one left alive. She is left with a choice: to live a life of violence, or to find a new purpose.

Annabelle chooses the latter, and sets off into the wasteland, searching for a new purpose.
