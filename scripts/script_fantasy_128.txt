FADE IN:

EXT. LAND OF DARKNESS AND DESPAIR - DAY

A bleak and desolate landscape. The sun beats down mercilessly, and the land is parched and dry. There is no sign of life anywhere.

Suddenly, we hear a faint sound. It gets louder and louder, until we see a group of people, running for their lives. They are being chased by a horde of vicious creatures. The creatures are gaining on them.

The people are terrified. They have nowhere to go.

Suddenly, one of the people stops. He turns to face the creatures.

He is brave. He is strong.

He knows he cannot defeat the creatures alone, but he is not going to give up. He will fight.

He raises his weapon and charges at the creatures.

The others follow his lead. They stand together and fight.

The creatures are strong, but the people are braver. They slowly but surely start to win.

The creatures retreat into the darkness.

The people have won the first battle. But the war is far from over.
