FADE IN:

EXT. JUPITER - DAY

Linda (30s) is a meteorologist, studying the weather patterns on Jupiter from a distance. She's been tracking a large storm brewing for weeks, and she's finally able to get a closer look when her team is sent on a mission to investigate.

The closer they get to the storm, the more dangerous it becomes, and they soon find themselves in the middle of it. Linda is able to use her knowledge to help the team navigate their way out, but they all know they're lucky to be alive.

Linda: This is incredible. I've never seen anything like it.

Team Leader: We're lucky to be alive. Let's get out of here.
