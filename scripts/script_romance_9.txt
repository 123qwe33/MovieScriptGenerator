FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

RACHEL and ALEX are sitting at a table, talking and laughing. They seem to be really enjoying each other's company.

RACHEL

So, what do you do?

ALEX

I'm a lawyer. I work at a big firm downtown.

RACHEL

That's great! I'm an accountant. I work at a small firm, but I like it.

ALEX

That's really cool.

They continue to chat and it's clear they are really hitting it off.

RACHEL

Do you have a girlfriend?

ALEX

Yes, I do. Her name is Sarah.

RACHEL

That's a pretty name. I have a boyfriend, his name is Tim.

ALEX

That's a great name.

They continue talking and it's obvious they are interested in each other. However, they are both in relationships with other people.

RACHEL

We should exchange numbers. I feel like we could be great friends.

ALEX

I agree.

They exchange numbers and say goodbye.

FADE OUT.
