FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - THE USS ENTERPRISE

The USS Enterprise, a sleek and powerful starship, hurtles through space.

INT. THE USS ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

The bridge of the Enterprise is a bustling center of activity. Captain James Kirk, a handsome and confident man in his early thirties, sits in the captain's chair.

At his side is his first officer, Mr. Spock, a stoic and logical Vulcan.

KIRK:

Mister Spock, what is the status of our mission?

SPOCK:

Captain, we are on course to the planet Altair VI. We should arrive in orbit in approximately three hours.

KIRK:

Very good, Mister Spock.

Kirk stands and walks over to the viewscreen, where the planet Altair VI can be seen.

KIRK:

Altair VI. The Federation's newest colony. I have a good feeling about this mission, Mister Spock.

SPOCK:

Indeed, Captain.

Kirk turns and walks back to his chair. He sits down and looks over at Spock.

KIRK:

Mister Spock, you have the bridge. I'm going to my quarters.

SPOCK:

Very well, Captain.

Kirk stands and walks off the bridge.

FADE OUT.
