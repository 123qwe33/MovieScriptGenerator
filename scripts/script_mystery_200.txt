FADE IN:

EXT. SMALL TOWN - DAY

The town is quiet and peaceful. Birds are singing and the sun is shining.

Suddenly, a woman's body is seen lying in a pool of blood. She has been brutally murdered.

The camera pans to a nearby house where the detective in charge of the case, JAMESON, is being briefed by the police chief.

JAMESON

What do we know?

POLICE CHIEF

Not much. The victim is a young woman, around twenty years old. We haven't been able to identify her yet.

JAMESON

Any witnesses?

POLICE CHIEF

No, not yet. But we're canvassing the area.

JAMESON

All right. I'll take a look at the body.

 Jameson walks over to the body and kneels down next to it. He looks at the woman's face and then notices something in her hand.

JAMESON

What's this?

He takes the object from her hand and holds it up to the light. It's a small key.

JAMESON

Do we know what this unlocks?

POLICE CHIEF

No, we don't. But we'll find out.

JAMESON

All right. Let's get started.
