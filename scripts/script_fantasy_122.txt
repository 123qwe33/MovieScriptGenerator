FADE IN:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

A group of bandits on horseback ride through the woods, Sarah (20s) captive on one of the horses. She is beaten and bruised, her clothes ripped and tattered. The bandits laugh and jeer at her as they ride.

BANDIT 1

Hey, girlie. You're gonna have a good time with us tonight.

BANDIT 2

Yeah, we're gonna show you a real good time.

Sarah says nothing, her head hung low. She is in shock, her mind numb from the ordeal.

The bandits ride to a remote cabin in the woods and take Sarah inside. They tie her to a chair and start to rape and torture her.

SARAH

(screaming)

No, please stop!

The bandits only laugh and continue their assault. Sarah is left battered and bruised, her body and soul broken.

The next day, the authorities catch up to the bandits. They are all arrested and taken away, leaving Sarah behind.

Sarah is found by a kindly old woman who takes her in and helps her heal. With her newfound strength, Sarah sets out to find the bandits and make them pay for what they did to her.

Sarah eventually finds the bandits and kills them all, but not before they take her on one last brutal journey.

FADE TO BLACK.
