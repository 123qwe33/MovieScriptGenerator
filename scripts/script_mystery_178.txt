FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

A man walks quickly through the dark and rain-soaked streets. He's wearing a trenchcoat and hat, and he looks like he's seen better days. He's the city's most famous private detective, and he's on a case.

He stops at a payphone and drops some coins into the slot. He dials a number and waits.

DETECTIVE:

Yeah, it's me. I need to see you.

He hangs up the phone and starts to walk away, but he's stopped by a woman's voice.

WOMAN:

Excuse me, sir?

He turns to see a beautiful woman standing in the shadows.

WOMAN:

I need your help.

DETECTIVE:

What can I do for you, ma'am?

WOMAN:

I'm accused of murder. But I didn't do it.

The detective looks at her skeptically.

DETECTIVE:

That's what they all say, ma'am.

WOMAN:

Please, I'm desperate. I'll pay you anything.

The detective thinks for a moment. Then he nods.

DETECTIVE:

All right, ma'am. I'll take your case.

CUT TO:

INT. DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY

The detective is sitting at his desk, going through some files. The beautiful client is sitting across from him.

DETECTIVE:

So, let's start at the beginning. What's your name?

WOMAN:

My name is Sarah. Sarah Miller.

DETECTIVE:

And you say you didn't kill him?

WOMAN:

I swear, I didn't do it.

The detective looks at her skeptically.

DETECTIVE:

Do you have any idea who did?

WOMAN:

No. I mean, I have my suspicions. But I don't know for sure.

The detective leans back in his chair and looks at her.

DETECTIVE:

All right, Sarah. I'll see what I can do.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

The detective is talking to a police officer.

DETECTIVE:

So, what can you tell me about the victim?

POLICE OFFICER:

Not much, I'm afraid. He was a well-connected politician. That's about all we know.

DETECTIVE:

What about the suspects?

POLICE OFFICER:

All powerful people with something to hide.

The detective nods.

DETECTIVE:

I see. Thanks for your help.

CUT TO:

INT. DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY

The detective is on the phone.

DETECTIVE:

Yeah, I need some information on a guy. His name is John Miller.

He listens for a moment, then hangs up the phone. He looks over at Sarah.

DETECTIVE:

I'm sorry, Sarah. But your husband was cheating on you.

Sarah looks down at her hands.

SARAH:

I see.

DETECTIVE:

Is there anything else you want to tell me?

SARAH:

No. That's all.

The detective nods.

DETECTIVE:

All right. I'll be in touch.

CUT TO:

INT. SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Sarah is sitting in her living room, drinking a glass of wine. She's on the phone.

SARAH:

I need your help.

She listens for a moment, then hangs up the phone. She looks over at the detective, who is sitting across from her.

DETECTIVE:

All right, Sarah. I'll take your case.

FADE OUT.
