FADE IN:

EXT. PLANET - DAY

We see a planet that is ravaged by war. There is destruction everywhere, and the skies are filled with the smoke of battle. On the horizon, we see two massive armies facing each other, ready to fight.

In the midst of this, we see a small group of scientists working in a laboratory. They are frantically working on a new weapon.

Scientist 1: We're almost ready. Just a few more adjustments.

Scientist 2: We don't have much time. The military leaders are getting impatient.

Scientist 1: I know. But if we rush this, it could be very dangerous.

Scientist 2: I know. But we may not have a choice.

The scientists continue to work, desperate to find a way to test the weapon.

FADE OUT.
