FADE IN:

EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

We see rolling hills and fields of green as far as the eye can see. The sun is shining and there is a light breeze.

We hear the sound of a car engine as a small hatchback comes into view, driving down a dirt road. The car comes to a stop and we see JULIETTE (30s) get out. She is wearing a summer dress and carrying a small suitcase. She looks around, taking in the sights and sounds of the countryside.

JULIETTE

(smiling to herself)

It's been too long.

She walks towards the house and we see that she is carrying a key. She unlocks the door and steps inside.

INT. JULIETTE'S HOUSE - DAY

The house is small but cozy. It is clear that it has been well-kept. Juliette puts her suitcase down and looks around.

JULIETTE

(voiceover)

This place holds so many memories.

She walks over to the window and looks out.

JULIETTE

(voiceover)

It's good to be home.

CUT TO:

EXT. LUCAS'S HOUSE - DAY

We see a small farmhouse in the distance. There are chickens running around in the yard and we can hear the sound of a tractor in the distance.

LUCAS (30s) is in the yard, tending to the chickens. He looks up as he hears the sound of a car approaching. He smiles as he sees Juliette's car pull up.

LUCAS

(calling out)

Juliette!

He runs over to meet her as she gets out of the car. They hug each other tightly.

LUCAS

(smiling)

It's so good to see you!

JULIETTE

(returning the smile)

You too, Lucas. It's been too long.

LUCAS

(nodding)

Come on, I'll show you around.

He takes her suitcase and leads her into the house.

CUT TO:

INT. LUCAS'S HOUSE - DAY

Lucas gives Juliette a tour of the house. It is clear that he lives alone.

LUCAS

(pointing things out as he speaks)

This is the living room, that's the kitchen, and this is my bedroom.

He opens the door to his bedroom and we see that it is very simple, with just a bed and a dresser.

JULIETTE

(smiling)

It looks exactly the same as it did when we were kids.

LUCAS

(chuckling)

Yeah, I never saw the need to change it.

He puts her suitcase down in the guest bedroom, which is across the hall from his room.

JULIETTE

(looking around the room)

This was my room when I was growing up.

LUCAS

(nodding)

I know. I thought you might want to stay in here while you're here.

JULIETTE

(smiling)

Thank you, Lucas.

CUT TO:

EXT. LUCAS'S FARM - DAY

Lucas takes Juliette on a tour of his farm. He shows her the chickens, the tractor, and the fields.

JULIETTE

(impressed)

This is amazing, Lucas. You've really done well for yourself.

LUCAS

(shrugging)

I guess. It's not as glamorous as your life, but it suits me.

JULIETTE

(smiling)

I don't know about that. I think it looks pretty perfect to me.

CUT TO:

EXT. LUCAS'S FARM - LATER

Lucas and Juliette are sitting on the porch, drinking lemonade.

LUCAS

(smiling)

It's so good to have you back, Juliette. I've really missed you.

JULIETTE

(returning the smile)

I've missed you too, Lucas. This place is exactly what I needed.

LUCAS

(nodding)

I'm glad you came back.
