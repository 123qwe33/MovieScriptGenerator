FADE IN:

EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

Raj (20s) and Simran (20s) stand on opposite sides of the platform, waiting for their train to Delhi. They both check their watches and then look up at the arriving train.

Raj: That's our train.

Simran: Finally! I thought it would never get here.

They both step onto the train and find their seats. Raj is in the aisle seat and Simran is in the window seat.

Raj: Hi, I'm Raj.

Simran: Hi, I'm Simran.

Raj: Nice to meet you.

Simran: You too.

They both settle into their seats and the train starts to move.

Raj: So, where are you headed?

Simran: Delhi. My family lives there.

Raj: Delhi is my hometown too. I'm going to visit my family.

Simran: That's great. I'm sure they'll be happy to see you.

Raj: I hope so. I haven't seen them in a while.

Simran: How long have you been away?

Raj: A few years. I've been living in Mumbai.

Simran: That's where I'm from.

Raj: Really? What a small world.

They both smile and settle back into their seats. The train ride is long, but they enjoy each other's company. They talk and laugh and quickly fall in love.

When they reach Delhi, they both realize they have to go their separate ways. Simran is heartbroken, but Raj promises to find her again. He eventually tracks her down and they rekindle their romance. They get married and live happily ever after.
