FADE IN:

EXT. A SMALL TOWN IN INDIA - DAY

We see a bustling small town in India. There are people everywhere, going about their daily lives.

Suddenly, we hear a commotion. We see a group of people running towards something.

We follow the group and see that they are running towards a burning building.

We see a man and a woman inside the building, desperately trying to escape the flames.

The man is Romeo, and the woman is Juliet.

The crowd watches in horror as the two people inside the burning building are consumed by the flames.

FADE TO BLACK.

We see a funeral procession making its way through the town.

We see Romeo and Juliet's parents, grieving the loss of their children.

As the procession passes, we see people staring at the parents with pity and disdain.

We also see a young boy, watching the procession from a distance. He has a look of determination on his face.

This boy is Romeo and Juliet's son.

FADE TO BLACK.
