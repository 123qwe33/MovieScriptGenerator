Mallika:

(to herself)

He's so handsome... I have to meet him.

She starts to make her way through the crowd.

Mallika:

Excuse me, pardon me...

Finally, she reaches Rahul.

Mallika:

Hi, I'm Mallika. I couldn't help but notice you from over there.

Rahul:

Hi, I'm Rahul.

Mallika:

I know this might sound crazy, but I feel like I'm supposed to meet you.

Rahul:

That does sound crazy.

Mallika:

I know. But I just have this feeling.

Rahul:

Well, it was nice to meet you, Mallika.

Mallika:

Wait, don't go! Can I have your number?

Rahul:

Uh, sure.

He gives her his number and she gives him a big smile.

Mallika:

I'll call you.

Rahul:

I'll be waiting.

Mallika walks away, giddy with excitement. She knows he's the one.
