FADE IN:

EXT. JULIA'S GREAT-AUNT'S HOUSE - DAY

Julia (20s) stands in front of the house, looking uncertain. She's holding a key in one hand, and a suitcase in the other. She takes a deep breath, then unlocks the door and steps inside.

INT. JULIA'S GREAT-AUNT'S HOUSE - DAY

The house is musty and dusty, but it's clear that someone has been taking care of it. Julia puts her suitcase down and looks around.

Suddenly, a black cat comes running into the room. Julia jumps, startled.

CAT

(meowing)

Julia relaxes a little and bends down to pet the cat.

JULIA

Hey, there. What's your name?

CAT

(meowing)

Julia laughs.

JULIA

I don't speak cat, sorry.

The cat meows again and rubs against Julia's leg.

JULIA

I guess you're friendly, at least.

Suddenly, the cat stops and looks at something behind Julia. Julia turns around and sees a dead body on the floor.

JULIA

(screaming)

FADE TO BLACK.
