FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREET - EVENING

Jenna is running down the street, her face red and sweaty. She's

breathing heavily and she looks like she's about to give up.

Suddenly, she collides with someone and falls to the ground.

JENNA

Oh, I'm so sorry!

RYAN

It's okay, I'm not hurt.

Jenna looks up and sees a handsome man staring down at her.

JENNA

Hi.

RYAN

Hi.

They stare at each other for a moment, then Ryan offers his hand

to help Jenna up.

JENNA

Thanks.

RYAN

No problem. Are you okay?

JENNA

Yeah, I'm fine. Just a little embarrassed.

RYAN

Don't be. It happens to the best of us.

Jenna smiles and they start walking in the same direction.

JENNA

I'm Jenna, by the way.

RYAN

Ryan. Nice to meet you, Jenna.

JENNA

You too, Ryan.

They walk in silence for a few moments, then Ryan clears his throat.

RYAN

So, um, do you live around here?

JENNA

Yeah, just a few blocks away.

RYAN

Do you mind if I walk you home?

JENNA

No, I don't mind.

They walk and talk for a while, until they reach Jenna's apartment

building.

RYAN

This is you, right?

JENNA

Yeah. Thanks for walking me home, Ryan.

RYAN

No problem. I had a great time.

JENNA

Me too.

RYAN

Maybe we can do it again sometime?

JENNA

I'd like that.

RYAN

Great. I'll call you, then.

JENNA

Okay.

They stare at each other for a moment, then Ryan leans in and kisses

her. Jenna is surprised, but she kisses him back.

JENNA

Goodnight, Ryan.

RYAN

Goodnight, Jenna.

Jenna watches as Ryan walks away, then she goes inside her apartment

building with a smile on her face.
