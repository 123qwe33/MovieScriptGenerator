EXT. JIYA'S HOUSE - DAY

Jiya (18) is outside playing with her friends. Her mother, Suman (40), is watching her from the window.

Jiya's friends leave and Jiya goes inside.

SUMAN
 Who were those girls?

JIYA
 Just some friends from school.

SUMAN
 You should invite them over for dinner sometime.

JIYA
 Okay, Mom.

Suman goes back to cooking. Jiya sits down at the table to do her homework.

JIYA
 (thinking out loud)
 I wonder what it would be like to have a boyfriend...

Suman overhears Jiya and comes over to her.

SUMAN
 What did you say?

JIYA
 Nothing, Mom.

Suman gives Jiya a stern look.

SUMAN
 You're too young to be thinking about boys. You should be focusing on your studies.

JIYA
 I am. I was just thinking out loud.

Suman doesn't believe Jiya.

SUMAN
 I don't want you seeing any boys, do you understand?

JIYA
 Yes, Mom.

Suman goes back to the kitchen. Jiya sighs and goes back to her homework.

Rohit (18) is playing tennis with his friends. Jiya is walking by with her mother. Rohit's friends whistle and catcall at Jiya. Rohit's friends are embarrassed, but Rohit just smiles.

ROHIT
 (to Jiya)
 Hi.

JIYA
 (to Rohit)
 Hi.

Suman grabs Jiya's arm and pulls her away.

SUMAN
 Come on, let's go.

Rohit's friends laugh at him.

FRIEND 1
 I can't believe you just talked to her.

FRIEND 2
 She's way out of your league, man.

Rohit is embarrassed, but he can't stop thinking about Jiya.

EXT. JIYA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jiya is sneaking out of her house. Rohit is waiting for her.

ROHIT
 Hi.

JIYA
 Hi.

Rohit takes Jiya's hand and they start walking.

ROHIT
 I can't believe we're doing this.

JIYA
 I know. My mom would kill me if she found out.

ROHIT
 My dad would too.

JIYA
 But it's worth it, right?

ROHIT
 Yeah.

They smile at each other and keep walking.

FADE TO:

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

Jiya and Rohit are in line to buy tickets.

ROHIT
 What movie do you want to see?

JIYA
 I don't know. What do you want to see?

ROHIT
 I don't know. What do you want to see?

JIYA
 Why don't we just see whatever is playing?

ROHIT
 Okay.

They buy their tickets and go into the theater.

FADE TO:

INT. MOVIE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

Jiya and Rohit are sitting in the back row. The movie is playing, but they're not really watching it. They're too busy making out.

ROHIT
 I wish we could be together all the time.

JIYA
 I know. But it's better this way. If my mom found out, she'd never let me see you again.

ROHIT
 My dad would kill me if he found out.

JIYA
 We'll just have to be careful.

They kiss again and watch the movie.

 Yeah.
