FADE IN:

EXT. SMALL TOWN IN COLORADO - DAY

Allison is driving into town, her car packed with all of her belongings. She's moving here from out of state, and she's not sure what to expect. She's hoping for a fresh start, but she's not sure if she's going to find it.

As she drives, she passes a sign that reads "Welcome to Shepherd's Glen." She's never heard of this place before, but it looks quaint and peaceful. She decides to give it a chance.

She arrives in the town square and parks her car. She gets out and stretches, taking in her new surroundings. There's a bakery, a grocery store, and a few other shops. It looks like a typical small town.

Allison is about to head into the grocery store when she sees someone out of the corner of her eye. It's a handsome man, and he's staring at her intently. She feels a sudden jolt of electricity and looks away, feeling flustered.

When she looks back, the man is gone. She wonders if she imagined it.

Shaking off the strange encounter, Allison goes into the grocery store. She's just finished shopping when she feels someone watching her again. She looks up and sees the same man from before. He's standing in the aisle, staring at her.

Allison feels her heart racing. She doesn't know what to do.

The man finally speaks.

LUKE

Hi.

Allison is startled. She didn't expect him to actually talk to her.

ALLISON

Hi.

LUKE

I'm sorry for staring. It's just that you look really familiar.

ALLISON

I do?

LUKE

Yeah. Have we met before?

ALLISON

No, I don't think so.

LUKE

That's strange. I could have sworn we had.

Allison is getting uneasy. She doesn't know what to say.

LUKE

Anyway, my name is Luke. What's yours?

ALLISON

Allison.

LUKE

Nice to meet you, Allison.

Allison forces a smile.

ALLISON

Nice to meet you too.

She starts to walk away, but Luke stops her.

LUKE

Wait. I know this might sound crazy, but would you like to get coffee or something? I feel like we have a lot to talk about.

Allison is taken aback. She doesn't know what to say.

ALLISON

Um, sure. That sounds nice.

She's not sure if she's making a mistake, but she decides to go with her gut.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Allison and Luke are sitting at a table, sipping their drinks. Allison is feeling a little bit better now that she's gotten to know Luke better. He's actually a really nice guy.

LUKE

So, Allison, tell me about yourself.

ALLISON

Well, there's not much to tell, really. I just moved here from out of state. I'm looking for a fresh start.

LUKE

What are you looking for specifically?

ALLISON

I don't know. A new job, new friends, just something different.

LUKE

I think you'll like it here. Shepherd's Glen is a great place.

Allison smiles.

ALLISON

I hope so.

Suddenly, the door to the coffee shop bursts open. A group of men and women come in, all of them wearing dark cloaks. Allison's heart races as she realizes they're vampires.

Before she can say anything, Luke grabs her hand and pulls her out of the chair.

LUKE

We have to go. Now.

Allison doesn't know what to do. She trusts Luke, so she follows him out of the coffee shop.

EXT. SHEPHERD'S GLEN - DAY

Allison and Luke are running through the town square, trying to lose the vampires. Allison is out of breath and terrified. She has no idea what's going on.

Suddenly, Luke stops and turns to face the vampires. He starts to transform into a werewolf right before Allison's eyes.

Allison is scared, but she knows that Luke is trying to protect her. She stands behind him, ready to face the vampires.
