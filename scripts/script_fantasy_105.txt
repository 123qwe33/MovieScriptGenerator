FADE IN:

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

ALISIA, a young woman in her twenties, walks through the village. The sun shines down on her as she makes her way to the center of the village. There, she meets up with her friend, JONAH.

ALISIA:

Jonah, I need your help.

JONAH:

What's wrong?

ALISIA:

It's my village. There's a group of marauders that have been terrorizing us. They've already killed half of the villagers and burned half of the houses.

JONAH:

That's terrible! What can I do?

ALISIA:

I need you to help me gather a group of heroes. We need to stop the marauders before they destroy the whole village.

JONAH:

I'll do whatever I can to help.

ALISIA:

Thank you, Jonah.

Jonah and Alisia walk off screen.

Alisia, Jonah, and their group of heroes are making their way through the forest. They are armed with swords, bows, and shields.

Suddenly, they are attacked by a group of marauders. The heroes fight bravely, but they are outnumbered and outmatched.

Alisia rallies her group and they push forward, fighting their way through the marauders. They reach the marauders' lair and confront them.

After a fierce battle, the heroes triumph and the village is saved.

FADE OUT.
