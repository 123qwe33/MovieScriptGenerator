EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

A lone warrior stumbles across a small camp of survivors. He joins their fight to stay alive, but quickly realizes that the real battle is just beginning.

SURVIVOR 1

What the hell happened out there?

SURVIVOR 2

I don't know. But we're not safe here.

SURVIVOR 3

We need to find a way to get out of here.

SURVIVOR 4

There is no way out. We're all going to die here.

SURVIVOR 5

No! We can't give up. We have to fight.

The survivors band together and start to plan their next move. But the warrior knows that the real battle is just beginning.
