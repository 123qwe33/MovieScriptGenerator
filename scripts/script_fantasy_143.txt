FADE IN:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

A young woman, KATE, is stumbling through the woods, barely able to stand. She's covered in dirt and her clothes are tattered. She's obviously been through a lot. She's starving and desperate.

Suddenly, she hears a noise in the distance. She tries to hide, but it's too late. A group of bandits, led by their leader, JASON, come into view.

JASON:

Well, well, well. What do we have here?

KATE:

Please, just let me go. I won't tell anyone, I promise.

JASON:

Oh, we'll let you go all right. But first, you're going to help us with a little problem we've been having.

The bandits start to circle around her. Kate is terrified.

JASON:

You see, this village we've been terrorizing has been giving us a lot of trouble lately. They're not playing by the rules. So, we're going to need you to go in there and give them a message.

KATE:

What message?

JASON:

You're going to tell them that they need to start paying their tribute, or else.

KATE:

Or else what?

JASON:

Or else we'll kill everyone in the village.

KATE:

Please, don't make me do this.

JASON:

I'm afraid you don't have a choice. Now, go.

The bandits shove Kate in the direction of the village and she stumbles off, terrified of what she's about to do.

FADE TO:

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Kate approaches the village, her heart heavy with dread. She has no idea what she's going to say to these people.

Suddenly, she's surrounded by a group of armed villagers. They're all looking at her with suspicion.

KATE:

Please, I'm not here to hurt anyone. I'm just delivering a message.

VILLAGER 1:

What message?

KATE:

The bandits are demanding tribute. They say if you don't start paying, they'll kill everyone in the village.

The villagers all start to murmur in fear. Kate can see the terror in their eyes.

VILLAGER 2:

What are we going to do?

VILLAGER 1:

We can't fight them. They're too strong.

KATE:

Maybe I can help you.

VILLAGER 1:

Who are you?

KATE:

My name is Kate. I was on my way to the next town when I got lost. Your village saved me. I feel like I owe you.

VILLAGER 2:

Kate, we can't ask you to do this. It's too dangerous.

KATE:

I want to help. I can't just stand by and watch these bandits destroy your lives.

The villagers all look at each other, unsure of what to do. Finally, they nod in agreement.

VILLAGER 1:

All right, Kate. We'll let you help us.

FADE TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Kate is sneaking through the woods, following the bandits. She's getting closer and closer to their camp.

Suddenly, she hears a noise behind her and she spins around, ready to fight. But it's just one of the villagers, JAVIER.

JAVIER:

Kate, it's me. I followed you.

KATE:

Javier, what are you doing here? You could have been killed.

JAVIER:

I wanted to help.

KATE:

You're not helping. You're just putting yourself in danger.

JAVIER:

I can help. I know I can.

KATE:

Fine. But you have to do exactly what I say, understand?

JAVIER:

Yes, of course.

KATE:

All right. Let's go.

FADE TO:

EXT. BANDIT CAMP - DAY

Kate and Javier are hiding in the bushes, watching the bandits. They're getting ready to leave for the village.

Kate knows this is her chance. She has to take them down before they get to the village.

She
