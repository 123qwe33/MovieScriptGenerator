FADE IN:

EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

A young woman, SARAH, is picking flowers in a field. She sees a young man, MATHIEU, riding a horse in the distance and is instantly smitten.

SARAH

Who is that?

She runs to the fence and tries to get a better look, but he's gone.

SARAH

(to herself)

I'll never see him again.

Suddenly, MATHIEU appears next to her, having jumped off his horse.

MATHIEU

Bonjour, mademoiselle.

SARAH

(embarrassed)

Oh, I didn't see you there.

MATHIEU

I couldn't help but notice you watching me.

SARAH

(flustered)

I wasn't watching you. I was just, um, admiring the view.

MATHIEU

(charming)

Then I'm sure you won't mind if I admire it with you.

He climbs over the fence and SARAH's heart flutters.

SARAH

(smiling)

I don't mind at all.
