FADE IN:

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

JENNA is walking home from work, carrying a stack of papers. She's exhausted from her job as a teacher, and she's looking forward to her Friday night routine.

JENNA

(to herself)

Just a few more steps, and I can relax for the rest of the night.

Suddenly, her mailman, NATE, comes around the corner and waves to her.

NATE

Hey, Jenna! I've got your mail here.

JENNA

(surprised)

Oh, thanks, Nate.

NATE

(flirting)

You know, I was thinking... maybe you'd like to go out for coffee or something sometime?

JENNA

(hesitant)

Um, I don't know...

NATE

(persistent)

Come on, it'll be fun. I promise.

JENNA

(giving in)

Okay, sure. Why not?

NATE

Great! I'll pick you up tomorrow at 7?

JENNA

(smiling)

Sure. See you then.

NATE

(walking away)

Bye, Jenna!

JENNA

(to herself)

Well, that was unexpected. I wonder if this is going to be a good thing or a bad thing...

FADE TO:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

JENNA and NATE are sitting at a table, drinking coffee and chatting. They seem to be really hitting it off.

JENNA

So, what made you decide to become a mailman?

NATE

(shrugging)

I don't know. I just always liked the idea of being the one who brings people their mail. It's like being a part of their day, you know?

JENNA

(smiling)

Yeah, I can see that.

NATE

(changing the subject)

So, what do you do?

JENNA

I'm a teacher. I just finished my first year of teaching, actually.

NATE

(impressed)

That's great! I bet you're really good at it.

JENNA

( bashful)

Thanks. I love it, but it's definitely a lot of work.

NATE

(sympathetic)

I can imagine. But I'm sure your students love you.

JENNA

(smiling)

Yeah, I think they do.

 They continue to chat, and it's clear that they're really enjoying each other's company.

NATE

(checking his watch)

Wow, I didn't realize it was so late. I should probably get going.

JENNA

(disappointed)

Oh, okay.

NATE

(standing up)

I had a really great time, Jenna. We should do this again soon.

JENNA

(smiling)

I'd like that.

NATE

(leaning in for a kiss)

Goodnight, Jenna.

JENNA

(kissing back)

Goodnight, Nate.

 They share a passionate kiss, and then they go their separate ways. Jenna knows that she's found something special.

FADE TO:

EXT. PARK - DAY

JENNA and NATE are on a picnic date. They're laughing and having a good time, and it's clear that they're head-over-heels in love with each other.

NATE

(smiling)

I'm so glad you said yes to going out with me, Jenna.

JENNA

(giggling)

I'm glad you asked.

NATE

(serious)

I know we haven't been dating for very long, but I want you to know that I'm in this for the long haul. I want to be with you, Jenna.

JENNA

(touched)

I feel the same way, Nate. I'm so in love with you.

NATE

(smiling)

I was hoping you'd say that.

He pulls a small box out of his pocket and opens it to reveal a diamond ring.

NATE
