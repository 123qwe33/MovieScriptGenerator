FADE IN:


EXT. WOODS - DAY

Byren is running through the woods, playing an imaginary game of sword fighting. He ducks and weaves between the trees, slashing at the air with his make-believe sword.

Suddenly, he stops. He hears a noise. A strange noise. He looks around, trying to see where it's coming from.

Byren: Hello? Is someone there?

The noise gets louder. It sounds likeâ€¦singing? Byren follows the noise until he comes to a clearing.

And there it is. A strange looking stone, shining and pulsing with a weird light. Byren feels drawn to it and he slowly reaches out to touch it.

Suddenly, he's hit with a vision. He sees himself leading an army of brave warriors into battle. He sees himself slaying a dragon. He sees himself crowned king.

The vision is so real and so detailed that Byren is shaken to his core. He knows that it is a sign. A sign that he is destined for great things. Things that he could never even imagine.

From that day on, Byren was a changed man. He trained hard, determined to become the warrior he saw in his vision. He wanted to make his family proud. And one day, he would be the king of his people.

FADE OUT.
