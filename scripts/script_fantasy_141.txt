FADE IN:

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Sevrin, a young man in his early 20s, is running through the woods, panting and sweating. He's being chased by a group of men with torches and dogs. He's been on the run for years, and he knows that they're going to catch him sooner or later. He comes to a clearing and sees a small village on the other side. He knows that he can't let them catch him, so he decides to make a run for it.

He sprints towards the village, but the men are right behind him. He's about to enter the village when something grabs him from behind and drags him into the woods.

Sevrin wakes up to find himself in a small cave. He has no idea how he got there. He hears the men outside, searching for him. He knows that he has to find a way out.

Suddenly, he hears a noise in the darkness. Something is coming towards him. He can't see what it is, but he knows that it's not human. He tries to run, but it's too late. The creature catches him and kills him.

As he dies, he sees the creature for what it really is: a young girl who is lost and confused.
