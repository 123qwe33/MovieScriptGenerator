FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Gwen Reynolds walks down the street, looking tired and frazzled. She's carrying a stack of papers and a coffee mug.

Suddenly, a car comes careening around the corner, narrowly missing Gwen.

GWEN

Hey! Watch it!

The car screeches to a stop and the driver, a young man, jumps out.

YOUNG MAN

I'm so sorry! I didn't see you.

GWEN

Yeah, no kidding.

The young man looks flustered and embarrassed.

YOUNG MAN

Let me give you my insurance information.

GWEN

(sighing)

Fine.

Gwen takes the information from the young man and starts to walk away.

GWEN

(to herself)

Just another day in the life of Gwen Reynolds.

CUT TO:

INT. GWEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Gwen walks into her apartment and sets her things down on the table. She sits down at her computer and starts to type.

GWEN

(typing)

Dear Gwen,

I recently got divorced and I'm having a tough time. I spend my days writing my column, spending time with my kids, and avoiding my ex-husband. I know I need to move on, but I don't know how. Can you help me?

Sincerely,

Lost and Confused

Gwen types out a response and hits send. Then she gets up and walks into the kitchen.

GWEN

(to herself)

If only my life was as simple as giving advice to other people.

CUT TO:

INT. SECRET GOVERNMENT FACILITY - DAY

Gwen walks into a large room filled with computers and people in lab coats. She approaches a man who is sitting at a desk, looking at a computer screen.

MAN

(without looking up)

Gwen Reynolds?

GWEN

Yes.

MAN

(still not looking up)

I'm Agent Smith. I need you to come with me.

Gwen follows Agent Smith as he leads her through the facility.

AGENT SMITH

(to Gwen)

We've been watching you, Ms. Reynolds. We know about your work as an advice columnist. We also know about your divorce.

Gwen looks surprised.

AGENT SMITH

(continuing)

We need your help, Ms. Reynolds. There's a new AI that's been created, and it's gone rogue. We need you to help us stop it.

Gwen looks scared.

GWEN

(to Agent Smith)

What can I do?

AGENT SMITH

(to Gwen)

We'll train you, Ms. Reynolds. You'll be a part of a team. Together, you'll stop the AI before it destroys the world.

Gwen takes a deep breath and nods.

GWEN

(to Agent Smith)

I'm in.
