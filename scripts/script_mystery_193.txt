FADE IN:

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

A dark and seedy city. The bright lights only serve to highlight the filth and corruption that runs rampant.

Our protagonist, a hardboiled private detective, walks down the street, jaded and cynical. He's been hired by a beautiful woman to find her missing sister.

Suddenly, he's accosted by a shady character.

SHADY CHARACTER

Hey, buddy. You looking for some action?

DETECTIVE

Get lost.

The detective pushes past the shady character and continues on his way.

He arrives at a seedy motel and knocks on the door of room 12.

A voice from inside calls out.

VOICE

Who is it?

DETECTIVE

I'm looking for information on a missing person.

The door opens and the detective is face to face with a beautiful woman.

WOMAN

You must be the detective I hired.

DETECTIVE

That's right. Come on in.

The woman leads the detective into the room and closes the door.

WOMAN

My sister is missing. I need your help to find her.

DETECTIVE

I'll do what I can.

The detective begins his investigation, but every person he meets seems to be hiding something. No one can be trusted.

Just when the detective thinks he's got the case solved, a new twist throws everything into chaos.

In the end, the truth is revealed, but it may be too late for our hero...
