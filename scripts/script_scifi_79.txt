FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - ASTEROID FIELD

The Reliant is a small freighter ship, making its way through the asteroid field. The ship is battered and old, and the crew is tired. They've been on this run for weeks, and they're ready to go home.

Suddenly, the ship's sensors pick up something strange. There's a ship nearby, adrift in the asteroids.

 captain, we've got a ship on our sensors. It's not responding to hails.

The captain, a weary woman named JANET, comes to the bridge. She looks at the ship on the screen.

JANET

What is it?

Pilot, a young man named PETER, checks the ship's readouts.

PETER

I don't know. It's not showing up on any of our databases.

JANET

Is it human?

PETER

I can't tell. But whatever it is, it's in trouble.

JANET

All right. Let's go take a look.

The ship changes course and heads for the lost vessel.

INT. RELIANT - BRIDGE

The crew of the Reliant is on the bridge, watching as the ship approaches the lost vessel.

JANET

Can you tell what kind of ship it is?

PETER

No. It's not like anything I've ever seen before.

JANET

What about its registration?

PETER

There is no registration. It's not listed anywhere.

JANET

That's not possible. Every ship in the galaxy has to be registered.

 PETER

Maybe it's not from around here.

JANET

Or maybe someone doesn't want us to know who it is.

The ship is getting closer.

JANET

Ready the boarding party. I want to know what's on that ship.

INT. RELIANT - AIRLOCK

The boarding party, made up of JANET, PETER, and two other crew members, suit up in their space suits.

JANET

All right, let's go.

The team enters the airlock and starts to cycle the air out.

Suddenly, the ship shakes.

JANET

What was that?

PETER

I don't know.

JANET

Can you get a read on the other ship?

PETER

No. It's like it's not there.

JANET

What do you mean?

PETER

I mean, it's like it's not really there. It's like it's not really a ship.

JANET

What are you talking about?

Suddenly, the ship shakes again, harder this time.

JANET

We're under attack!

The ship's alarms start to sound.

JANET

What's going on?

PETER

I don't know. But whatever it is, it's coming for us.
