FADE IN:

EXT. FIELD - DAY

A young boy, WILL, is working in a field. He stops to rest, wiping the sweat from his brow. He looks up at the sky, which is dark and stormy.

Suddenly, a gust of wind blows through the field, scattering Will's tools. He tries to chase after them, but the wind is too strong.

Will looks around, confused. He has never seen a storm like this before.

Suddenly, he hears a voice calling his name. It's his grandmother, ELINOR.

ELINOR
Will! Will, come inside quickly!

Will runs to the house, where his grandmother is waiting for him.

ELINOR
It's started. The evil is coming. You must go, Will. You must find the others. Only together can you hope to defeat it.

Will doesn't understand, but he knows his grandmother is serious. He nods and runs out the door.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Will is running through the forest, trying to find his way. He's never been this far from home before.

Suddenly, he hears a noise in the bushes. He draws his sword, ready to defend himself.

But instead of a monster, he finds a small, injured rabbit.

He looks around, trying to find its mother, but there's no sign of her.

Will sighs and picks up the rabbit, cradling it in his arms. He knows he can't leave it here to die.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Will enters the village, the rabbit still in his arms. He's never been to this village before, but he knows he needs help.

He sees a group of people gathered around a man in a hooded cloak. The man is speaking in a strange, foreign language.

Will approaches the group and taps the man on the shoulder.

When the man turns around, Will sees that he has a long, white beard. He looks like a wizard.

WILL
Excuse me, sir. I'm looking for help.

The wizard, GANDALF, looks at Will and the rabbit. He nods and beckons for Will to follow him.

GANDALF
I think I can help you, young man.
