FADE IN:

EXT. HIGH FANTASY WORLD - DAY

A group of humans are walking through a forest, on their way to the kingdom of the elves. They are carrying weapons and armor, and they look like they are ready for war.

HUMAN 1

Do you really think this is going to work?

HUMAN 2

I don't know. But we have to try something.

HUMAN 1

I just don't want to die.

HUMAN 2

We're all going to die someday.

Suddenly, they hear a noise in the distance.

HUMAN 3

What was that?

HUMAN 2

I don't know. Let's go check it out.

They start to walk towards the noise, when they see something that they can't believe.

HUMAN 3

It's a gate!

HUMAN 2

It must be a way to the other world!

HUMAN 1

The elves are going to pay for this!

They all walk through the gate, and they are amazed by what they see.

FADE TO:

EXT. UTOPIA - DAY

The humans are in awe of the beauty of this world. There are flowers everywhere, and the sun is shining.

HUMAN 1

This is amazing!

HUMAN 2

We should take this world for ourselves!

HUMAN 3

The elves are never going to know what hit them!

Suddenly, they hear a noise in the distance.

HUMAN 2

What was that?

HUMAN 3

I don't know. Let's go check it out.

They start to walk towards the noise, when they see something that they can't believe.

HUMAN 3

It's the elves!

HUMAN 2

They must have found out about the gate!

HUMAN 1

We have to stop them!

The humans and the elves start to fight, and the humans are winning some battles and the elves are winning others. In the end, the elves are victorious, and they take over the utopia. The humans are forced to flee back to their own world, where they must start rebuilding their kingdom.

FADE TO BLACK.
