FADE IN:

EXT. TAKESHI'S HOUSE - DAY

Takeshi is in his workshop, tinkering with a car engine. His sister Yuki comes in.

YUKI

Hey, Takeshi. I need to borrow your car.

TAKESHI

What for?

YUKI

I have a date.

TAKESHI

With who?

YUKI

With a guy I met online.

TAKESHI

You're going on a date with a guy you met online? That's not safe.

YUKI

I'll be fine. I'll be back later tonight.

TAKESHI

Okay, but be careful.

YUKI

I will. Thanks, Takeshi.

Takeshi watches as Yuki gets in her car and drives away. He has a bad feeling about this.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE BLUE CAT - NIGHT

Yuki's car pulls up to the Blue Cat, a seedy nightclub in a bad part of town. She hesitates for a moment, then gets out of the car and goes inside.

CUT TO:

INT. THE BLUE CAT - NIGHT

Yuki approaches the bar. Misaki, the singer onstage, sees her and smiles. Yuki smiles back and starts to walk over to her.

Suddenly, Yuki's date grabs her arm and drags her towards the back of the club. Yuki tries to pull away, but he's too strong.

YUKI

Let go of me!

DATE

Come on, baby. I just want to show you a good time.

YUKI

No! Help!

Misaki sees what's happening and comes over.

MISAKI

Let her go.

DATE

Who the hell are you?

MISAKI

I'm the singer here. And this is my club. So I'm telling you to let her go.

DATE

Fine. I don't need this hassle.

He pushes Yuki away and storms out of the club. Yuki falls to the ground, crying. Misaki helps her up.

MISAKI

Are you okay?

YUKI

Yes. Thank you.

MISAKI

Come on, let's get you a drink.

CUT TO:

INT. THE BLUE CAT - LATER

Yuki is sitting at the bar, nursing a drink. Misaki sits down next to her.

MISAKI

Bad date?

YUKI

The worst. I can't believe I was so stupid.

MISAKI

Don't be too hard on yourself. These things happen.

YUKI

I guess.

MISAKI

Listen, I know this might sound crazy, but I think I know your sister.

YUKI

What do you mean?

MISAKI

I think she's in trouble. And I think I know who took her.
