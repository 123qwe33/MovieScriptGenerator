FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

A busy city street. People are walking around, going about their business.

Suddenly, a woman SCREAMS.

People start running and screaming. A man lies on the ground in a pool of blood.

Detective JAMESON (40s) is on the scene. He looks around, taking in the scene.

He sees a woman crying over the body.

WOMAN

He just came out of nowhere and stabbed him!

Detective Jameson looks at the body. There is a single red rose sticking out of the man's chest.

He looks around, but he doesn't see anyone suspicious.

He takes out his notebook and starts writing.

FADE OUT.
