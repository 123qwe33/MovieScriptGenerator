FADE IN:

EXT. SHEPHERDSTOWN - DAY

The small town of Shepherdstown is nestled in the mountains of West Virginia. It's a peaceful place, with a slow pace of life.

Emily Charmichael is driving into town, her car packed with all her belongings. She's moving here from New York City, after the success of her first novel. Emily is looking forward to a slower pace of life, and to opening her own bookstore.

As she drives down Main Street, she sees a sign for the Shepherdstown Bookstore. It's a small, quaint store, and it looks like it's been here for years. Emily is excited to get started on her new life.

INT. SHEPHERDSTOWN BOOKSTORE - DAY

Emily walks into the store, and is met by the owner, Mrs. Saunders.

MRS. SAUNDERS

Welcome, Emily. I'm so glad you're here.

Emily smiles and shakes Mrs. Saunders's hand.

EMILY

Thank you. I'm excited to get started.

MRS. SAUNDERS

Good. I'll let you get settled in, then.

Emily starts unpacking her boxes of books, and arranging them on the shelves. She's excited to get the store up and running.

A few hours later, the doorbell rings, and Emily sees a woman walking in. She's middle-aged, and she looks distraught.

Emily walks over to the woman.

EMILY

Can I help you?

The woman, Abbey, looks at Emily with desperation in her eyes.

ABBEY

Yes. I need your help. My husband is dead, and I know it was murder.

Emily is taken aback by Abbey's claim.

EMILY

I'm sorry, but I don't think I can help you.

Abbey pleadingly grabs onto Emily's arm.

ABBEY

Please. The police aren't taking me seriously. But I know he was murdered. I just need someone to believe me.

Emily looks into Abbey's eyes, and she can see the desperation there. She decides to help her.

EMILY

Okay. I'll see what I can do.

Emily starts talking to Abbey's husband's friends and family, trying to piece together what happened. She quickly realizes that there are a lot of people who had motives to kill him.

As she starts to put the pieces of the puzzle together, she becomes more and more convinced that Abbey is right, and that her husband's death was not an accident.

But just as she's about to uncover the truth, the killer strikes again, and Emily finds herself in grave danger.
