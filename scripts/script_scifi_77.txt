FADE IN:

EXT. TATOOINE - DAY

A desert planet, with two suns in the sky. We see a small farmhouse in the distance.

We hear a voiceover from LUKE SKYWALKER, a young man in his early twenties.

LUKE

Tatooine. A planet of sand and sun. And not much else.

We see Luke out in the fields, working on a droid.

LUKE (V.O.)

I'm a farm boy, born and raised here. My father was a moisture farmer. My mother... I never knew her. She died when I was very young.

We see Luke inside the house, eating dinner with his uncle and aunt.

LUKE (V.O.)

My uncle and aunt took me in and raised me as their own. I was happy here. I had everything I needed.

But I always knew there was something more out there. Something... calling to me.

We see Luke looking up at the stars at night.

LUKE (V.O.)

I used to dream about becoming a pilot, and flying off to see the galaxy. But that was just a dream.

Until one day, everything changed.

We see Luke out in the fields again, when he hears a strange noise. He looks up to see a ship landing.

LUKE (V.O.)

A ship came to our farm. And on that ship was a droid. A droid that changed my life forever.
