FADE IN:


EXT. SPACE - THE FAR FUTURE

The vastness of space stretches out in all directions. In the distance, a great interstellar empire shines. But it is in decline, beset by internal strife and external threats.


Suddenly, a great war erupts that threatens to destroy all that humanity has built. In the midst of this crisis, a ragtag group of rebels overthrow the corrupt government.


But they quickly realize that the task is far greater than they imagined. They must deal with enemies both within and without, as they struggle to bring order to the chaos. Can they succeed? Or will the empire fall once and for all?


FADE TO BLACK.
