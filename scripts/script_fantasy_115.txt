FADE IN:

EXT. MOUNT OLYMPUS - DAY

We see a group of gods sitting on their thrones, looking down on the mortals below.

Zeus: The mortals are constantly fighting with each other. They are so troublesome.

Apollo: They are indeed. What should we do, father?

Zeus: We shall withdraw our support from them. Let them fend for themselves.

All the gods nod in agreement.

FADE TO:

EXT. A VILLAGE IN ANCIENT GREECE - DAY

We see a group of villagers gathered around a well.

Villager 1: The water in the well has dried up. What are we going to do?

Villager 2: I don't know. We need water to survive.

Suddenly, a man appears in the distance. He is carrying a large jug of water.

Man: I have water!

The villagers gather around him.

Man: I was blessed by the gods. They told me to give this water to you.

Villager 1: Thank the gods!

Man: They also told me that I must defeat the evil that has taken hold of the world.

Villager 2: What evil?

Man: I don't know. But I must gather a group of brave souls and set out on a journey to find it.

The villagers all look at each other, unsure of what to do.

Man: Who will join me on this quest?

Villager 1: I will!

Villager 2: And so will I!

Soon, a group of villagers set out on a journey with the man. They face many challenges along the way, but they overcome them all. Finally, they reach their destination.

Man: This is it. The evil is inside this castle.

The group enters the castle and is met by a group of evil creatures.

Man: We must fight!

In a titanic battle, the group emerges victorious. The evil is defeated and peace is restored to the world.
