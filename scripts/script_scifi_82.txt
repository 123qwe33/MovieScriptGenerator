FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - THE HAZARD SHIP

The Hazard ship is a large, imposing vessel, adorned with spikes and skulls. It's clear this ship means business.

Suddenly, the ship is attacked by a rival pirate crew. Lasers and missiles fly through the air.

INT. THE HAZARD SHIP - THE BRIDGE

Captain John Hazard is at the helm of the ship, fighting desperately to keep it afloat.

Suddenly, a missile hits the ship, and it starts to crumble.

CAPTAIN JOHN HAZARD

No! This can't be happening!

The ship explodes, and John is blown out into space.

EXT. SPACE - JOHN, FLOATING IN THE VOID

John is floating in the void, his ship destroyed. He is all alone.

Suddenly, a ship comes into view. It's the ship of the notorious pirate queen, Blackheart.

JOHN

(to himself)

No... it can't be...

The ship pulls alongside John, and a tractor beam pulls him in.

INT. BLACKHEART'S SHIP - JOHN'S CELL

John is thrown into a cell and the door is locked behind him.

JOHN

(to himself)

This is it... I'm finished...

Suddenly, the door to the cell opens and Blackheart walks in.

BLACKHEART

Welcome to my ship, John Hazard.

JOHN

(to Blackheart)

You! You're the one who destroyed my ship!

BLACKHEART

(laughs)

Yes, I destroyed your ship. And now I'm going to destroy you.

JOHN

(to Blackheart)

You're going to have to kill me first.

BLACKHEART

(to John)

Oh, I don't plan to kill you, John. I have something much better in mind for you.

Blackheart walks over to John and looks him in the eye.

BLACKHEART

(to John)

I'm going to make you an offer, John. Join my crew and serve me, or be executed. What's it going to be?

JOHN

(to Blackheart)

I would rather die than serve you.

BLACKHEART

(to John)

Very well. Guards!

Two burly guards come into the cell and grab John.

BLACKHEART

(to John)

Enjoy your last days, John Hazard. You will be executed at dawn.

The guards drag John out of the cell and the door is locked behind him.

JOHN

(to himself)

I won't give up... I'll find a way out of here...

FADE TO BLACK.
