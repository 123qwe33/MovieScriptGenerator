INT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

A body lies in a pool of blood, a single gunshot wound to the head.

DETECTIVE SAMUELS (40s) kneels down next to the body, examining it. He looks up as a uniformed COP approaches.

COP

What do we have here?

DETECTIVE SAMUELS

Another one.

COP

That makes three this week.

DETECTIVE SAMUELS

Yeah, something's definitely going on.

COP

You think it's related to the other cases?

DETECTIVE SAMUELS

I don't know. But I'm going to find out.

COP

Be careful, Sam. These cases are starting to get dangerous.

DETECTIVE SAMUELS

Don't worry, I can handle it.

COP

I hope so. We need you on this.

DETECTIVE SAMUELS

I'll do my best.

COP

That's all anyone can ask.

The COP walks away as DETECTIVE SAMUELS looks down at the body, lost in thought.
