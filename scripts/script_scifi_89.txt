FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE

The vastness of space is shown, with stars shining and planets rotating. A small ship is shown travelling through the emptiness.

INT. SHIP

The ship is shown to be old and run down, with a small crew of tired-looking people. One of them, a woman, is at the controls.

WOMAN

We've been travelling for weeks now, and we're no closer to finding a new home.

MAN

(sighing)

I know. But we have to keep looking. We can't give up now.

WOMAN

I know. I just wish there was some other way.

Suddenly, the ship is rocked by a explosion.

MAN

What was that?

WOMAN

I don't know. But we're losing power.

The ship starts to lose altitude, and the crew starts to panic.

WOMAN

(into intercom)

Mayday! Mayday! We're under attack!

Suddenly, the ship is hit again, and this time it starts to break apart.

MAN

(to woman)

Get to the escape pods! I'll try to hold the ship together!

The woman nods, and runs off. The man tries to keep the ship together, but it's too late. The ship explodes, and he is killed.

FADE OUT.
