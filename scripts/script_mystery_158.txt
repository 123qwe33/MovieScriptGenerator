EXT. SHEPHERDSTOWN LIBRARY - DAY

The small town of Shepherdstown is nestled in the mountains of Virginia. The town is picturesque, with a Main Street lined with shops and businesses. The library is one of the town's most beloved landmarks.

Today, the library is closed. A police cruiser is parked out front, and a small crowd of townspeople has gathered.

JAKE SHEPHERD, the town's police chief, is talking to NANCY, Penelope's best friend.

JAKE

I'm so sorry, Nancy. We did everything we could.

NANCY

(tearfully)

I know. Thank you, Jake.

JAKE

If there's anything I can do, please, just let me know.

NANCY

(nods)

I will.

JAKE turns and walks back to the police cruiser. He gets in and drives away.

NANCY watches him go, then turns and goes back into the library.

INT. SHEPHERDSTOWN LIBRARY - DAY

NANCY enters the library and goes to the front desk. She looks around, taking in the empty shelves and the dust that has gathered in the quiet space.

NANCY

(to herself)

This was always her dream, you know. To have a library of her own.

NANCY sits down at the desk and begins to cry.
