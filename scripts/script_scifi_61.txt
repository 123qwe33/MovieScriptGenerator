FADE IN:

EXT. PLANET - DAY

Samantha and her team are testing a new device that will allow them to travel to different parts of the universe without having to leave their spaceship. They are also testing a new type of fuel that will allow them to travel faster than the speed of light. When they are ready to test the new device, they launch their spaceship and travel to a nearby planet.

Samantha: We're almost there. Are you ready?

Team Member: Ready as I'll ever be.

Samantha: Okay, here we go.

They activate the device and travel to the nearby planet.

Samantha: Wow, it worked.

Team Member: Look, over there.

They see a strange creature that is lurking in the shadows. The creature is about to attack them when Samantha's team uses the new device to travel back to their own planet.

Samantha: What was that thing?

Team Member: I don't know, but I'm glad we're back on our own planet.
