FADE IN:

EXT. SHANNON'S FARM - DAY

The sun is just peeking over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the farm. Shannon is walking through the fields, her father's arm around her shoulders.

SHANNON

I can't believe it's been a year already.

FARMER BROWN

Time flies when you're having fun, Shannon.

SHANNON

I'm not sure I'd call farming fun.

FARMER BROWN

It's not always easy, but it's worth it.

SHANNON

I guess so.

FARMER BROWN

I know so.

They both laugh and Shannon leans her head against her father's shoulder.

FARMER BROWN

I'm proud of you, Shannon. You've really stepped up this past year.

SHANNON

Thank you, Daddy.

FARMER BROWN

I know your mother would be proud of you too.

SHANNON

I miss her.

FARMER BROWN

I know, sweetheart. I miss her too.

They stand there in silence for a moment, both lost in their own thoughts.

FARMER BROWN

Well, I should get to the fields.

SHANNON

Okay. I'll see you later.

FARMER BROWN

Shannon?

SHANNON

Yes?

FARMER BROWN

I love you.

SHANNON

I love you too, Daddy.

FARMER BROWN

Diego!

Diego, a young migrant worker, comes running over.

FARMER BROWN

Can you give Shannon a hand with the irrigation system?

DIEGO

Sure thing, boss.

FARMER BROWN

Thanks, Diego.

Diego and Shannon walk off in the opposite direction.

SHANNON

So, Diego, where are you from?

DIEGO

Mexico. I came here with my family a few years ago.

SHANNON

Do you like it here?

DIEGO

It's not easy, but I'm grateful for the opportunity to work.

SHANNON

My father always said that the hardest workers are the ones who appreciate what they have.

DIEGO

Your father is a wise man.

SHANNON

He is.

Diego and Shannon continue to talk as they walk to the irrigation system. They soon reach it and start to work.

SHANNON

So, Diego, have you ever been in love?

DIEGO

No, I haven't.

SHANNON

Really? What about your family? Are they still in Mexico?

DIEGO

Yes, they are. I miss them a lot.

SHANNON

I'm sure they miss you too.

Diego and Shannon continue to talk as they work. They soon finish and start to walk back to the farmhouse.

SHANNON

I should get inside. My father will be wondering where I am.

DIEGO

I should get back to work too.

SHANNON

It was nice talking to you, Diego.

DIEGO

You too, Shannon.

They both smile and go their separate ways.
