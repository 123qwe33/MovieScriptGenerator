FADE IN:

EXT. KINGDOM OF ALABASTER - DAY

The kingdom of Alabaster is in turmoil. The king has been assassinated and the queen has been kidnapped. The prince, who was away at the time of the attack, must now return home and take up the mantle of king.

He arrives at the castle to find it in ruins. The once great kingdom is now in shambles. He is met by the captain of the guard, who tells him that the queen is being held in the dungeon.

The prince makes his way to the dungeon, where he finds his mother chained to a wall. She is weak and frail, but she is alive.

The prince frees his mother and they make their escape. But they are pursued by the evil wizard who is behind the coup. The wizard is a powerful sorcerer and he will not rest until he has destroyed the prince and taken the kingdom for himself.

The prince and his mother flee into the forest, where they are met by a band of rebels. The rebels are fighting against the wizard and his army. They agree to help the prince rescue his mother and restore the kingdom to its rightful place.

The prince and his army of rebels march to the wizard's castle and lay siege to it. After a fierce battle, they triumph and the wizard is defeated. The prince and his mother are reunited and the kingdom is saved.
