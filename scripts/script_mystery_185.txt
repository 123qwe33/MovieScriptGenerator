FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

Kiryu, a small-time private investigator, is walking down a busy city street. He's looking around, as if he's looking for someone.

Suddenly, he's approached by a man in a dark suit.

MAN

Kiryu?

Kiryu nods.

MAN

I need you to find someone for me.

Kiryu looks at the man skeptically.

MAN

I'll pay you well.

Kiryu shrugs.

KIRYU

Sure, why not.

The man hands Kiryu a photo of a young woman.

MAN

Her name is Ai. I need you to find her.

Kiryu looks at the photo.

KIRYU

I'll see what I can do.

The man hands Kiryu a stack of cash.

MAN

This should cover your expenses.

Kiryu nods and pocket the money.

KIRYU

I'll be in touch.

The man nods and walks away.

Kiryu looks at the photo of Ai again, then heads off down the street.

FADE OUT.
