FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY

A planet is floating in the vastness of space. It is a beautiful planet with blue oceans and green continents. There are no signs of life.

Suddenly, a bright light appears in the sky. It is a spacecraft from another galaxy. It is huge and menacing.

The spacecraft starts attacking the planet. It fires its weapons and destroys everything in its path.

The peace-loving aliens are forced to fight back. They use their advanced technology to defend their home.

During the battle, the aliens discover that the attacking spacecraft is powered by a powerful crystal. They also find out that the crystal is the source of the aliens' strength and power.

With this new-found knowledge, the aliens are able to defeat the attacking aliens and send them back to their own galaxy.

The planet is saved and the aliens can return to their peaceful ways.
