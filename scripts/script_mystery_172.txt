FADE IN:

EXT. ROCKSVILLE - DAY

A small town in the middle of nowhere. The sun is shining and the birds are singing.

INT. DONNA'S BOOKSTORE - DAY

Donna is unpacking boxes of books. She is a woman in her early thirties. She is pretty, but there is a sadness in her eyes.

 DONNA

(to herself)

This is going to be my new start.

She hears the door open and looks up to see a woman coming in.

WOMAN

Hi, I'm looking for a book on gardening.

DONNA

(smiles)

I think we can help you with that.

She leads the woman to the gardening section. As she is helping the woman, she sees a man out of the corner of her eye. He is tall and handsome, with dark hair. He is looking at her.

DONNA

(to the woman)

Do you need any help finding anything else?

WOMAN

No, I think I've found everything I need.

She walks away and the man comes over to Donna.

MAN

Hi. I'm sorry to bother you, but I couldn't help but notice you're new in town.

DONNA

(smiles)

Yes, I just moved here.

MAN

I'm Bill. I live down the street. I just wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood.

DONNA

(smiles)

Thank you. I'm Donna.

BILL

(smiles)

It's nice to meet you, Donna. I'll let you get back to work. I'll see you around.

He walks out of the store. Donna watches him go, then goes back to work.

INT. DONNA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Donna is in her pajamas, reading a book in bed. There is a knock on her door. She gets up to answer it.

BILL

(smiles)

Hi, Donna. I hope I'm not disturbing you.

DONNA

(smiles)

No, not at all. What can I do for you, Bill?

BILL

(hesitates)

I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I should check on you. I know you're new in town and I just wanted to make sure you're settling in okay.

DONNA

(smiles)

That's very kind of you, Bill. I appreciate it.

BILL

(smiles)

I just wanted to make sure you're okay. I'll let you get back to your book. I'll see you around.

He walks away. Donna watches him go, then goes back inside and closes the door.

INT. DONNA'S BOOKSTORE - DAY

Donna is helping a customer when she sees Bill walk in. He comes over to her.

BILL

Hi, Donna. I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I should stop by and say hi.

DONNA

(smiles)

Hi, Bill. What can I do for you?

BILL

(hesitates)

I was just wondering if you're free for dinner tonight.

DONNA

(smiles)

I'd love to.

BILL

(smiles)

Great. I'll pick you up at seven.

He walks out of the store. Donna watches him go, then goes back to work.

INT. DONNA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Donna is getting ready for her date with Bill. There is a knock on her door. She goes to answer it.

BILL

(smiles)

Hi, Donna. You look beautiful.

DONNA

(smiles)

Thank you. You look very handsome.

BILL

(smiles)

Shall we go?

DONNA

(smiles)

Yes, let's go.

They walk out of the house and get into Bill's car. He drives them to a restaurant.

BILL

(smiles)

I hope you like Italian food.

DONNA

(smiles)

I love Italian food.

They walk into the restaurant and are seated at a table. They order their food and start to talk.

BILL

So, tell me about yourself, Donna.

DONNA
