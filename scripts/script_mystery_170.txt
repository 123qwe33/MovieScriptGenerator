FADE IN:

EXT. CATAMOUNTAIN LODGE - DAY

The sun is just peeking over the mountains as we pull up to the lodge. A quaint little bed and breakfast, it looks like the perfect place to get away from it all.

We head inside, where we're met by MRS. DANVERS, the owner. She's a kind-faced woman in her 60s, with a warm smile.

MRS. DANVERS

Welcome to Catamountain Lodge.

DARCY, a woman in her early 30s, steps forward. She's Mrs. Danvers' niece and the one who called us here.

DARCY

Thank you for coming, (NAME). This is my cat, Sherlock.

She holds up a black cat, who looks unimpressed.

DARCY (CONT'D)

He's going to help us solve the mystery.

MRS. DANVERS

That's very kind of you, Darcy, but I'm sure the police will find out who did this.

DARCY

I'm not leaving until we catch the killer, Auntie.

MRS. DANVERS

Suit yourself. I'll just go make some breakfast.

She heads into the kitchen, leaving Darcy and Sherlock alone.

DARCY

Let's get to work, Sherlock.

CUT TO:

INT. CATAMOUNTAIN LODGE - KITCHEN

Mrs. Danvers is busy at the stove, humming to herself. She doesn't hear the person come up behind her until it's too late.

Suddenly, she feels a sharp pain in her back and she falls to the floor.

MRS. DANVERS

(gasping)

Help!

But there's no one there to hear her.

MRS. DANVERS (CONT'D)

(coughing)

Darcy...

But she's losing consciousness fast.

MRS. DANVERS (CONT'D)

(whispering)

Help me...

FADE TO BLACK.
