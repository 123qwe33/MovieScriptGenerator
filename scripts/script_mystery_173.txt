FADE IN:

EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

Lydia Gold walks up to the front doors of the library, a large, imposing building. She unlocks the doors and steps inside.

Lydia: (to herself) Just another day at the library.

She walks through the stacks of books, running her fingers along the spines. She stops at a row of books and starts to shelve them.

Lydia: (to herself) I love this job. It's so peaceful.

She continues shelving books until she comes to a stop at a book that doesn't belong. She looks around, confused.

Lydia: (to herself) That's strange. I don't remember seeing that book before.

She reaches for the book and pulls it off the shelf. As she does, she hears a noise coming from the other side of the shelf.

Lydia: (to herself) What was that?

She cautiously walks around the shelf and comes face-to-face with a dead body.

Lydia: (screaming) AHHHH!

She falls backwards, tripping over a stack of books. She hits her head on the floor and passes out.

FADE TO BLACK.
