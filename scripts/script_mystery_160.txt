This pie is going to be perfect.

She puts the pie in the oven and sets the timer.

I hope the farmer's market is busy today. I could really use the extra money.

She wipes her hands on a towel and goes to the living room. She looks out the window and sees a crowd of people walking down the street.

MRS. HERBERT

(to herself)

She grabs her purse and keys and heads out the door.

It's just...I found out that my husband is cheating on me.

MRS. HERBERT

(sympathetically)

I'm so sorry, Mrs. Wilkinson. That must be really tough for you.

MRS. WILKINSON

(nodding)

It is. I just don't know what to do.

MRS. HERBERT

If you need someone to talk to, you can always come to me. I'm always happy to listen.
