FADE IN:

EXT. LILLIAN'S BED AND BREAKFAST - DAY

Lillian Harper is busy tending to her garden when she hears a commotion coming from the backyard.

LILLIAN

Peggy, is that you?

She walks around the side of the house and sees her best friend, Peggy, arguing with a man.

PEGGY

I told you, I don't know where she is!

MAN

You're lying! I know she was here.

PEGGY

Get off my property before I call the police!

The man gets in his car and drives away. Peggy sees Lillian and tries to play it off.

PEGGY

Lillian, I didn't see you there.

LILLIAN

What was that all about?

PEGGY

Oh, nothing. Just some guy looking for his lost dog.

Lillian isn't convinced.

LILLIAN

Peggy, you know you can tell me anything.

PEGGY

I know. It's just... complicated.

Lillian gives her a hug.

LILLIAN

It's okay. I'm here for you, no matter what.

PEGGY

Thanks, Lillian.

Lillian goes back to her gardening, but she can't shake the feeling that something is wrong.

EXT. LILLIAN'S BED AND BREAKFAST - NIGHT

Lillian is in her backyard, hanging laundry on the clothesline. She hears a noise and turns around, but there's nobody there.

LILLIAN

Is someone there?

She looks around, but there's still nobody there. She goes back to her work, but she can't shake the feeling that someone is watching her.

INT. LILLIAN'S BED AND BREAKFAST - NEXT MORNING

Lillian is in the kitchen, preparing breakfast for her guests. She hears a knock at the door and goes to answer it.

LILLIAN

Good morning.

She opens the door to find a police officer on her doorstep.

POLICE OFFICER

Lillian Harper?

LILLIAN

Yes, that's me.

POLICE OFFICER

I'm sorry to tell you this, but we've found a body in your backyard.

LILLIAN

What?

The officer hands her a business card.

POLICE OFFICER

We'll need you to come down to the station and answer some questions.

LILLIAN

Of course.

The officer leaves and Lillian stares at the business card, her hand shaking.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Lillian is sitting at a table, being interrogated by two police officers.

POLICE OFFICER #1

Can you tell us what happened last night?

LILLIAN

I was hanging laundry in the backyard and I heard a noise. I looked around, but there was nobody there.

POLICE OFFICER #2

Did you see anyone suspicious in the area?

LILLIAN

No, I didn't.

POLICE OFFICER #1

Do you have any idea who could have done this?

LILLIAN

No, I don't.

The officers exchange a look.

POLICE OFFICER #2

We'll need you to stay in town for the time being.

LILLIAN

Of course.

INT. LILLIAN'S BED AND BREAKFAST - DAY

Lillian is in the kitchen, preparing breakfast for her guests. Peggy comes in, looking worried.

PEGGY

Lillian, have you seen this?

She shows her a newspaper article with the headline "Local Woman Suspected in Murder."

LILLIAN

What? That's ridiculous!

PEGGY

I know. But we need to find out who did this and clear your name.

LILLIAN

You're right. I can't let them accuse me of something I didn't do.

PEGGY

I'll help you, Lillian. We'll figure this out together.

LILLIAN

Thank you, Peggy.
