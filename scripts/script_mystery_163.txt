FADE IN:

EXT. SMALL TOWN - DAY

We see a small town in the middle of nowhere. There's a main street with a few shops and a bakery. We see ANGELICA, a woman in her early 30s, as she's moving into town. She has a few boxes in her car.

ANGELICA

(to herself)

This is it. My fresh start.

She gets out of the car and starts to unload her boxes. A few people walk by and stare at her.

ANGELICA

(to the people)

Hi, I'm Angelica. I'm the new owner of the bakery.

WOMAN

(to Angelica)

We'll see about that.

Angelica gives the woman a confused look as she walks away.

ANGELICA

(to herself)

What was that about?

She shrugs it off and continues to unload her boxes.

CUT TO:

INT. BAKERY - DAY

Angelica is in her bakery, putting the finishing touches on her first batch of cupcakes. The doorbell rings and she goes to answer it.

ANGELICA

(to the person at the door)

Hi, welcome to my bakery.

She sees that it's the police.

ANGELICA

(to the police)

Is everything okay?

POLICE OFFICER

(to Angelica)

We need to ask you a few questions.

ANGELICA

(to the police)

Sure, come in.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Angelica is being questioned by the police.

POLICE OFFICER

(to Angelica)

Where were you last night at around midnight?

ANGELICA

(to the police)

I was home in bed.

POLICE OFFICER

(to Angelica)

Can anyone verify that?

ANGELICA

(to the police)

No, I live alone.

POLICE OFFICER

(to Angelica)

We have a witness who says they saw you near the scene of the crime.

ANGELICA

(to the police)

That's impossible. I didn't leave my house last night.

POLICE OFFICER

(to Angelica)

I'm afraid we're going to have to ask you to come down to the station for further questioning.

ANGELICA

(to the police)

But I didn't do anything!

CUT TO:

INT. ANGELICA'S BAKERY - DAY

Angelica is back in her bakery, with a few of her new friends. They're all talking about the murder investigation.

ANGELICA

(to her friends)

I can't believe they think I did it. I didn't even leave my house last night.

FRIEND 1

(to Angelica)

Don't worry, we'll help you clear your name.

FRIEND 2

(to Angelica)

We'll find the real killer.

ANGELICA

(to her friends)

Thank you. I don't know what I would do without you.

FRIEND 1

(to Angelica)

We're glad you moved to town. We could use a good baker around here.

ANGELICA

(to her friends, smiling)

I'm glad I'm here too.
