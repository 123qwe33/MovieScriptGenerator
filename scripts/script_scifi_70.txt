FADE IN:

EXT. SCIENCE LAB - DAY

A group of scientists are gathered around a large machine. They are excited and nervous as they prepare to test it out.

One of the scientists, JAMES, walks over to a small metal object on a table. He picks it up and places it on a platform in the center of the machine.

JAMES

Here goes nothing.

He presses a button and the machine starts to whir. The metal object disappears.

JAMES

It worked!

The other scientists cheer and hug each other. They are excited about the possibilities of this machine.

JAMES

Now let's try a human.

One of the scientists, SARAH, volunteers to go first. She steps onto the platform.

JAMES

Are you sure you're ready for this?

SARAH

Yes. I'm excited to be the first person to travel through time.

JAMES

Okay. Here we go.

He presses the button and the machine starts to whir. But then there is a loud explosion.

JAMES

What happened?

SARAH

(screaming)

Help me!

The other scientists rush to her. They are horrified to see that she has been burned alive.

JAMES

(to the other scientists)

We have to destroy the machine.

The other scientists agree and they start to dismantle the machine.

But before they can, a group of criminals burst into the room.

LEAD CRIMINAL

Stop!

The criminals point their guns at the scientists.

LEAD CRIMINAL

We know what this machine can do. And we're going to use it to our advantage.

JAMES

(to the other scientists)

Do what they say.

The criminals force JAMES to operate the machine. They step onto the platform and disappear.

JAMES

(to the other scientists)

I'm sorry.

The other scientists are terrified. They have no idea what the criminals will do with the power to travel through time.
