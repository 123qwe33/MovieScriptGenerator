FADE IN:

EXT. SHEA - DAY

Shea is a small town nestled in the middle of a dense forest. It's a peaceful place, where the people have lived off the land for generations. But all of that is about to change.

Suddenly, a caravan arrives in town, led by a strange man who calls himself a wizard. He has dark power and soon takes control of the town, enslaving the people and using them for his own dark purposes.

The people of Shea must find a way to free themselves from the wizard's control and save their town before it's too late.
