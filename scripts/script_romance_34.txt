INT. ROHIT'S HOUSE - DAY Rohit is sitting at his desk, writing a letter. He pauses for a moment, thinking of the right words to say. He starts to write again, but then crumples up the paper and throws it in the trash. He takes a deep breath and starts again.

Dear Neha,

There's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time, but I was never sure how to say it. I'm not even sure if you'll feel the same way, but I have to tell you how I feel.

I've loved you since the day we met. I know we've always been just friends, but for me, it's always been more. I love the way you make me laugh, the way you're always there for me. I can't imagine my life without you.

I know this is a lot to take in, and I don't expect you to feel the same way. But I had to tell you how I feel. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

Love always,

Rohit

Dear Rohit,

I'm so sorry I didn't make it to the park today. I was held up at work and I didn't have time to call you. I hope you understand.

When I got home, I saw your letter waiting for me. I didn't know what to do, so I just sat down and read it. I'm so sorry, Rohit. I had no idea how you felt.

I love you too, Rohit. I've always loved you. I'm just as scared as you are of what people will say. But I can't deny my feelings any longer. I want to be with you, Rohit. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

I love you too, Rohit.
