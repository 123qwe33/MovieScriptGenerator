FADE IN:

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

chi walks down a dark, seedy street. He's a disheveled man, down on his luck. He looks around nervously, as if he's being followed.

Suddenly, he's grabbed from behind and shoved into an alley.

YAKUZA GOON

You're gonna help us, understand?

chi is terrified. He nods.

YAKUZA GOON

Good. Now, our boss was killed. We want you to find out who did it.

chi nods again.

YAKUZA GOON

You do that, and there's a lot of money in it for you.

chi is desperate. He knows he can't say no.

YAKUZA GOON

You got 24 hours.

chi is released and he staggers out of the alley. He knows he's in over his head, but he has no choice. He has to find the killer.

FADE OUT.
