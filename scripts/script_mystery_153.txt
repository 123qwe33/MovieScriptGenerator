INT. DAISY’S BAKERY - DAY

Daisy Goodwin is a young woman in her twenties, and she’s just opened her own bakery. She’s putting the finishing touches on a cake when her best friend, Suzy, comes in.

SUZY

Hey, Daisy!

DAISY

Hey, Suzy. What’s up?

SUZY

Not much. Just came to see your new place.

DAISY

What do you think?

SUZY

It’s great! You’ve really outdone yourself.

DAISY

Thanks. I’ve been working on it for months.

SUZY

So, what’s the latest gossip?

DAISY

Not much. Nothing ever happens around here.

SUZY

That’s true. But maybe that’s a good thing.

DAISY

I guess so.

SUZY

I should get going. I’ll see you later.

DAISY

Bye, Suzy.

SUZY

Bye, Daisy.

Someone killed her.

That’s terrible!

I know. The whole town is in shock.

Do they know who did it?

No. But everyone is a suspect.

That’s awful.

I know. I’m going to the church. I’ll see you later.
