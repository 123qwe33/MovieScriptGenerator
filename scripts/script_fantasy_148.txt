FADE IN:

EXT. DARK AND GRIM WORLD - DAY

Sarah wakes up, surrounded by the dead bodies of her parents. She is horrified and crying.

SARAH

(crying)

Mom! Dad! No!

Suddenly, Sarah is surrounded by a group of survivors. They are armed and dangerous, and they take her in.

SURVIVOR 1

Come with us, Sarah. We'll keep you safe.

SARAH

(crying)

Who are you?

SURVIVOR 2

We're the only ones left. We're all that's left of the resistance.

Sarah is taken to the resistance camp, where she is trained to fight and survive.

SURVIVOR 3

In this world, you have to be strong to survive. There's no room for weakness.

Sarah quickly learns that in order to survive, she must be strong and ruthless herself. She soon becomes a skilled warrior, and leads the survivors on a quest for revenge against the marauders.

Sarah and her team face many challenges, including battling giant monsters and overcoming obstacles created by the dark magic that permeates the land. In the end, Sarah and her team triumph, but at a great cost. Many of her friends and allies are killed, and Sarah is left scarred both physically and emotionally.
