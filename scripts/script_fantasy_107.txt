INT. THE SHIRE - DAY A young farm boy named FRODO BAGGINS is tending to his chores. He looks up at the sound of hoofbeats and sees a group of DWARVES riding into his farm. They dismount and approach him. DWARF 1 We're looking for a Hobbit to join our quest. DWARF 2 We need someone to help us reclaim our homeland. DWARF 3 Will you help us, Frodo? FRODO I'm not sure. What quest are you talking about? The Dwarves exchange looks. DWARF 1 We're looking for someone to help us destroy the One Ring. FRODO I've never even heard of the One Ring. The Dwarves look disappointed. DWARF 2 We were told you were the one. DWARF 3 The prophecy says you are the chosen one. FRODO I'm sorry, but I can't help you. The Dwarves turn to leave. DWARF 1 We'll find someone else. DWARF 2 There's still time. DWARF 3 The prophecy will come to pass. The Dwarves mount their horses and ride away. FRODO watches them go, wondering what the prophecy could mean. EXT. THE FOREST - DAY FRODO is walking through the forest, lost in thought, when he hears a voice calling his name. He looks around and sees an ELF standing in the shadows. ELF Frodo Baggins. I've been expecting you. FRODO Who are you? ELF My name is Legolas. I'm a friend of Gandalf's. He sent me to find you. FRODO Gandalf? I thought he was a myth. ELF He's very real, and he needs your help. FRODO What can I do? ELF There's a dark force threatening to destroy the balance. We need you to help us stop it. FRODO I don't know how to help. ELF You have magic powers, Frodo. You just need to learn how to use them. FRODO Magic powers? ELF Yes. You are the chosen one. The one who was prophesied to save us all. FRODO Me? I'm just a farm boy. ELF You are much more than that, Frodo. You have the power to change the world. Will you help us? FRODO I don't know. ELF We need you, Frodo. The future of our world depends on it. FRODO takes a deep breath and nods. ELF Welcome to the rebellion, Frodo.
