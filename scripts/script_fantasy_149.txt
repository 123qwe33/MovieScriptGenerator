FADE IN:

EXT. A BUSTLING CITY STREET - DAY

The camera pans across a busy city street. People of all walks of life are going about their day, going to work, running errands, etc. There is a feeling of peace and prosperity.

Suddenly, there is a loud explosion. People start screaming and running in all directions.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE SOURCE OF THE EXPLOSION - DAY

A large crater has been blown in the middle of the street. Cars are overturned and on fire. Bodies are strewn about.

From the crater, a group of creatures emerge. They are skeletal in appearance, with burning red eyes. They are the undead legions of the forces of darkness.

The creatures start slaughtering the people. They rip them apart with their bare hands, devouring their flesh. The people have no chance against them.

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY - DAY

More explosions are going off all over the city. The creatures are everywhere, killing and destroying everything in their path.

The camera pans across the city, showing the devastation. Bodies are everywhere. Blood is running in the streets. The city is in chaos.

INT. A DARK CASTLE - DAY

In the middle of the castle, there is a throne made of human bones. Sitting on the throne is a figure clad in dark armor. He is the leader of the forces of darkness.

He looks out over the city, watching as his creatures wreak havoc. A satisfied smile spreads across his face.

The time has come. The age of darkness is upon us once again.
