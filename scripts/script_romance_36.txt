INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - DAY Meena is in the kitchen, cooking with her mother. They are laughing and chatting as they work. Aman comes in, and Meena's mother scolds him for being late. Aman apologizes and goes to help Meena with the cooking. MEENA'S MOTHER We've been waiting for you. What took you so long? AMAN I'm sorry, I got held up at the market. MEENA'S MOTHER You're always getting held up at the market. What is it that you do there all day, anyway? AMAN I sell spices. MEENA'S MOTHER (to Meena) This one is going to be a bachelor forever. (to Aman) When are you going to find a nice girl and settle down? AMAN (to Meena) When are you going to find a nice boy and settle down? MEENA (laughs) I'm not in any hurry. I'm happy with my life the way it is. AMAN (to Meena's mother) Neither am I. I'm happy with my life the way it is. MEENA'S MOTHER (sighs) You're both too young to know what's good for you. (to Meena) Your father and I were married by the time we were your age. MEENA I know, Ma. But times have changed. AMAN (to Meena's mother) Times have changed. You can't expect us to do things the way you did. MEENA'S MOTHER (to Aman) I wasn't talking to you. (to Meena) I just want what's best for you, my child. MEENA I know, Ma. I appreciate your concern, but I can take care of myself. AMAN (to Meena's mother) We can take care of ourselves. MEENA'S MOTHER (ignoring Aman) Just promise me you'll think about it. MEENA I promise. Now, can we please get back to cooking? I'm starving. AMAN (to Meena) Yes, let's get back to cooking. I'm starving. MEENA'S MOTHER (sighs) Fine. But don't forget what I said. MEENA I won't. I promise. Aman and Meena exchange a look, and then get back to work. FADE OUT. INT. MEENA'S HOUSE - NIGHT Meena is in her room, writing in her journal. She smiles as she writes, lost in her own world. There is a knock at her door, and Aman comes in. AMAN Hey. What are you up to? MEENA Just writing. What are you up to? AMAN Just hanging out. I saw Raj today. MEENA Who's Raj? AMAN The guy who came to town a few weeks ago. He's staying at the hotel. MEENA Oh, right. I remember now. What about him? AMAN He was asking about you. MEENA (laughs) Why would he be asking about me? AMAN I don't know. He just was. He seems interested in you. MEENA (laughs) That's ridiculous. He's a rich businessman. He's probably just bored and looking for some entertainment. AMAN (smiles) Maybe. But it doesn't hurt to talk to him. MEENA (sighs) I don't know, Aman. I'm not interested in him. AMAN (teases) Not even a little bit? MEENA (laughs) No. Not even a little bit. AMAN (sighs) Okay. If you're not interested, you're not interested. But I think you should at least talk to him. He seems like a nice guy. MEENA (sighs) Fine. I'll talk to him. But I'm not going to like him, I can tell you that much. AMAN (smiles) We'll see. FADE OUT. INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY Raj is sitting in the lobby, reading a newspaper. Aman comes in and greets him. AMAN Hey, Raj. What's up? RAJ Not much. Just waiting for my meeting to start. AMAN How's it going? RAJ It's going well. I'm thinking about expanding my business. AMAN That's great. RAJ Yeah. I'm thinking about opening a hotel here. AMAN Really? That's fantastic. RAJ Yeah. I think it would be a good investment. What do you think? AMAN I think it's a great idea. RAJ (smiles) I'm glad you think so. I'll need a good manager. AMAN (laughs) I'm not qualified for that. RAJ (teases) I don't know. I think you're a pretty smart guy.
