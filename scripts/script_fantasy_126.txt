FADE IN:

EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

The last king of the realm lies dead on the battlefield, surrounded by the bodies of his fallen soldiers. The enemy's army stands triumphant over the carnage, their weapons still dripping with blood.

Aidan, the prince and heir to the throne, kneels beside his father's body. He looks up at the enemy with hatred in his eyes.

AIDAN

(to the enemy)

You will pay for this.

He stands and rallies the remaining forces of the kingdom.

AIDAN

(to the remaining forces)

We are not defeated yet! We will make them pay for what they've done!

The remaining forces cheer and follow Aidan into battle.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

The two armies clash in a hail of blood and steel. The fighting is fierce, but the kingdom's forces are outnumbered and outmatched.

In the midst of the battle, Aidan's wife is killed. He watches in horror as she falls to the ground, her blood staining the earth.

Aidan's best friend is mortally wounded. He kneels by his side, trying to stem the flow of blood.

AIDAN

(to his best friend)

Hold on, I'll get help.

But it is too late. His friend dies in his arms.

Aidan is surrounded by the enemy. He knows that he is about to die.

Suddenly, a dark stranger appears.

STRANGER

(to Aidan)

I can offer you power. The power to exact revenge on those who have destroyed your kingdom.

Aidan hesitates for only a moment before agreeing. He knows that there is no other way to save his friend's soul.

And so he strikes a bargain with the devil.
