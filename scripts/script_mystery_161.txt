FADE IN:

EXT. PEGGY SUE'S HOUSE - DAY

PEGGY SUE, a middle-aged woman, is coming home from work. She's tired and looking forward to a cozy evening at home with her cat, Mr. Noodles.

PEGGY SUE:

(to herself)

I can't wait to get my knitting project started. Mr. Noodles will keep me company while I work.

She goes into her house and sets out a bowl of food for Mr. Noodles. Then she settles into her chair with her knitting.

PEGGY SUE:

(to herself)

This is the life.

She takes a sip of tea, but her cup is empty.

PEGGY SUE:

(to herself)

That's odd. I could have sworn I just filled my cup.

She gets up to refill her cup and when she comes back, she finds Mr. Noodles with his paw in the bowl of food, looking guilty.

PEGGY SUE:

(to herself)

Mr. Noodles would never steal food. Something strange is going on here.

She starts to investigate. She talks to her neighbors, but no one saw anything. She's about to give up when she remembers the new family that moved in a few houses down. She goes to talk to them, and they tell her that they saw a black cat sneaking around Peggy Sue's house earlier in the day.

PEGGY SUE:

(to herself)

I've got my suspect. Now to set a trap.

She puts a dish of food in the middle of her living room and waits. Sure enough, the black cat comes slinking in. Peggy Sue grabs him and takes him to the pound.

The next day, she gets a call from the pound. They tell her that the cat is actually a Maine Coon and he belongs to the family down the street. They must have let him out when they moved in and he's been living in the neighborhood ever since.

PEGGY SUE:

(to herself)

I'm glad my mystery is solved and Mr. Noodles is innocent. I'm also glad to have made some new friends in the neighborhood.

FADE OUT.
