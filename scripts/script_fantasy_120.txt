FADE IN:

EXT. ALON'S FARM - DAY

We see a small farmhouse in the middle of a field. There is a young boy, ALON, working in the field.

ALON

(singing to himself)

Lalalalala...

Suddenly, a dark cloud appears in the sky and starts heading towards the farmhouse.

ALON

(continues singing)

La la la la...

The cloud gets closer and closer until it is right above the farmhouse. A bolt of lightning strikes the farmhouse and it bursts into flames.

ALON

(screaming)

Nooooooo!

He runs towards the burning farmhouse.

FADE TO BLACK.
