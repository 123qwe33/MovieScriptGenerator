FADE IN:

EXT. KINGDOM OF GLORIA - DAY

A beautiful kingdom lies before us, surrounded by mountains and forests. In the distance, we see a castle atop a hill.

Suddenly, there is a loud ROAR, and a giant dragon appears! It flies towards the castle, breathing fire.

The people of the kingdom scream in terror and run for their lives.

INT. CASTLE - DAY

Inside the castle, the king and his advisors are frantically trying to figure out what to do.

KING

What is happening?!

ADVISOR

Your Majesty, it's a dragon!

KING

I can see that! What do we do?!

ADVISOR

We must flee!

Suddenly, the door bursts open and a young woman enters.

WOMAN

I can help you!

KING

Who are you?

WOMAN

My name is Sarah. I have the power to control dragons.

KING

Can you stop this one?

SARAH

Yes, but I need your help.

The king and Sarah hurry out of the castle to face the dragon.
